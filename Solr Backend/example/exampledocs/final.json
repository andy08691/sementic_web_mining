I have taken part in the Dialectic Behavioral Therapy offered at my local CMHA about a year and a half ago. Besides struggling with BDP, I tend to struggle with Social Anxiety as well as Depression. To say the least, the pandemic has been a little overwhelming at times. Couple that with getting a new job in May of this year and I have been very anxious most days. One of the more ironic things about my employment is that I am working at my local CMHA so unfortunately, due to conflict of interest concerns I am not able to be treated there. I was referred to a different agency close to where I live, but I was not able to keep my appointments and my counselling just kinda fell off after a while. Around the same time I was also seeing a behavioral change counsellor about my substance abuse issues, but that also kinda just fell off at the start of the pandemic due to the counsellor I was seeing taking time off for personal safety reasons and neither one of us really following-up on things.

It was supposed to be a year filled with new experiences, momentous changes and achieving lifelong goals. For me personally, I had this notion in mind that this would be the year where all the plans I laid out would come to fruition through diligence and honing in on the infinite potential that lies within. Then COVID 19 happened. It was an entirely unexpected, unpredictable left turn. Suddenly. all the strategies I had been working on to push my dreams into reality had to be reassessed, if not, put on the back-burner entirely. But even beyond that I knew that so many people around the world have been suffering indescribable losses far beyond my comprehension due to this pandemic. In a way this can be felt in the air around us.\u00a0  As I've been attempting to adjust to this new routine, there have been ups and downs. An understanding that has helped me stay positive through all of this is realizing that sometimes the medicine that we need to heal us is often bitter. I think that being in isolation is forcing a lot of people to slow down and reassess their own priorities. In my case, it helped me stop and really strengthen my intentions as well as add more details to the goals that I had been visualizing. I only now understand how important this step is in my journey. If I look back at life, I know, beyond a doubt, that the most difficult experiences in my life became the catalyst through which I grew and changed for the better. I find solace in this awareness.\u00a0  Another mental exercise that has helped me is practicing mindfulness. Just last night, I watched a lecture which said that mindfulness is not just breathing or meditating but it is the simple act of being present... entirely present. By this, it means to not focus on the future or the past but to simply soak in where you are right now.

As with any other illness, you can protect yourself if you follow some basic steps. Here\u2019s how to keep yourself safe from the coronavirus:     1. Wash your hands. Every public restroom has this sign up for a reason. The point of washing your hands is to kill germs that you pick up from touching everyday surfaces. Viruses can live for a surprising amount of time on things like countertops, door handles and the like, but they can also be killed with soap and disinfectants containing alcohol. Whether you\u2019re in a public place or the comfort of your own home, regularly wash your hands with soap and warm water.     2. Avoid crowded locations. The best way to avoid getting sick is to avoid those who already are. Simple, right? Limiting your exposure means you\u2019ll be less likely to be infected, so stay away from crowded public places. When you have to leave the house, keep at least three feet between you and others when possible, and cover your nose and mouth if you suspect you\u2019re near someone who\u2019s sick.  3. Don\u2019t touch your mouth, nose, or eyes. These are the easiest places for a virus to enter your body, so don\u2019t give it a free ride. After you\u2019ve been in a public place, don\u2019t touch your face unless you\u2019ve washed your hands thoroughly. Even then, it\u2019s best to avoid contact. \u00a0", "responseCount": "11", "postDate": "1618074537", "id": 60}, {"source": "https://forums.livescience.com/threads/notice-live-science-forums-are-not-medical-advice-or-counsel.1308/", "question_title": "NOTICE: Live Science Forums are Not Medical Advice or Counsel", "question_text": "Our forums are welcoming venues for discussion and a useful resource for learning about the science of health and epidemiology, but it is critical to remember that forum posts are not reviewed by medical professionals.

This simple mathematical function indicates that over the course of the next month we could see a peak in deaths that rivals or exceeds the carnage from last year, even in nations with good vaccination rates such as the US and the UK.  I'm attaching plots for those nations with traces for the confirmed cases and the actual versus predicted deaths. This is no magic model. It's dirt simple and robust, with no state variables or feedback, and apparently also amazingly accurate.  I fine-tuned the lag time by evaluating the match between predicted vs actual deaths by eye. I also added two 'anchors' to better align the lag time to the early pandemic before testing became widespread when people were dying in hospital waiting rooms with zero advance notice of confirmed case. The lag time ramps up linearly from zero to maximum based on those two 'anchors'.  I'm attaching two plots each for these two nations, one with the full pandemic time series and another zoomed in from last winter's peak through today. The markers are set to the cases and predicted deaths that apply to today's prediction, so that you can see where we currently are on this trajectory.  According to my spreadsheet, this coming carnage is already baked in based upon the confirmed cases to-date. It's as if these people are already dead and just don't know it yet.  The principle unknown are how much vaccination and Omicron are improving the case fatality rate in the very short term. It is possible that a dramatic shift in the case fatality rate could perturb the predictive capability of the function. Since it relies upon the lag time of 24 days, there's a 48 day window where abrupt shifts in trends could perturb the result. News reports I've seen don't indicate that either vaccinations or the penetration of Omicron have dramatically changed the outlook in the short term. I'm expecting that this coming surge of deaths is at least partially real, and that my predictive function is keeping up with the trends. Improvement in case fatality rate over the past two years as treatments and vaccines were rolled out don't appear to have dramatically perturbed the historical performance of this predictive function. Delays in testing and reporting seem to be more of a factor, as indicated by abrupt excursions in the US data during/ following the holidays and also during/following the January 6th insurrection.  Recent deaths data in the US and the UK indicate that the uptick in deaths has already begun. This increase is clearly visible in the raw deaths data in my plots, doesn't show up in my symmetrical weighted 13 day running average deaths trace because there's a 6 day processing delay inherent in that averaging function and it's nearly a week behind this uptick. I chose that averaging function because it maximally preserves signal integrity while keeping the averaged trace time-aligned to the raw trace and also maximally flattens the weekly reporting cycle without overly suppressing detail in the traces. This allows the predictive function to closely follow the actual deaths with good fidelity and keeps the plots easily discernible while preserving as much information as possible.  I would have posted this data sooner if it was ready. I've been developing this spreadsheet since the beginning of the pandemic and it wasn't until this week that I finally got it working to the level where I felt confident in the results. I haven't seen anything similar anywhere else. The complicated epidemiological models don't provide such an accurate short-term prediction and the one at IHME isn't automatically updating. With my formula, I just download the latest data and the result is instantly available. It doesn't require any tweaking.  I'm using the Johns Hopkins Covid-19 cases/deaths time series database and the Our World In Data Covid-19 testing database. There's no mathematical magic and no super genius involved in this spreadsheet. Compared to what epidemiologists routinely do with their modeling, it's trivial. I'm amazed at how well it works. I wasn't expecting it to conform so closely to reality, but apparently when the pandemic data is good, so is the predictive capability of my spreadsheet.  I'll post updates as I improve the spreadsheet with more nations. I haven't added the two 'anchors' for other nations yet and I've recently rewritten the entire spreadsheet from scratch to clarify and simplify it. I'm hoping to eventually add it to GitHub where I'm getting my data from. My first version from nearly two years ago wasn't useful and was poorly received by the experts.

Probiotics supplementation could reduce the severity of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Probiotics can inhibit cytokine storm by simultaneously boosting the innate immunity and evading the exaggeration of adaptive immunity, which is challenged to respond quickly to the viral onslaught. Probiotics-induced suppression of the inflammatory cytokine response may prevent both the severity and the occurrence of ARDS, making probiotics an attractive adjunct. Inventing effective therapy will transform the impact of the pandemic on lives as well as economies across the globe. Therefore, supplementation of probiotics in high risk and severely ill patients, and frontline health workers, might limit the infection and flatten the COVID-19 curve. However, currently, there are no RCTs to demonstrate conclusive evidence. On the other hand, circumstantial evidence has supported the presumption that probiotic supplementation decreases the severity of COVID-19 responses, including mortality.

Apparently polypropylene sheets are charged via corona discharge treatment before manufacture into masks, filters etc.  For most daily use the sheets that comprise the masks retain their charge due to their electret properties but lose this charge when being washed. This is especially the case when alcohol is being used as a disinfectant which is an intuitive go to disinfectant in medical environments.  According to one study I read, this lose of static charge can lead up to 30% reduction in particle capture of the masks for 0.3 micron particles. For smaller particles in the range 0.1 microns (which is the size range of the Corona virus) and smaller the drop was less but still substantial. The interesting point is that these masks haven't mechanically degraded but rather simply have lost there endowed charge and would presumably be \"restored\" if \"recharged\".  As I mentioned apparently the charge is given to the material in manufacture by a corona discharge treatment. So this is my question since I am very much a layperson on materiel science, is it possible to simply restore charge to masks , filters etc in a simple manner?  Various scenarios and solutions have come to my mind from simply rubbing the inner lining with relevant material like rabbit fur to impart charge. Another is using the negative output of a Van de Graaff style generator to expose the mask to a negative static field. Another is using a modified negative ion generator (used in air purification) expose the mask to negative charged static charges.

As ILCs and T cells have many redundant functions, targeting and neutralizing their effector cytokines might be a better option. Alternatively, targeting their upstream activating mediators (IL-23, IL-1B, or IL-6), or their survival factors (IL-7) could be used as an approach to treat inflammatory diseases.  The epithelium comprises a physical barrier, which together with the mucus layer and production of anti-microbial peptides provides a containment barrier, which confines microbes in the lumen. The innate lymphoid cells residing in the immune compartment of the lamina propria, which is a thin layer of connective tissue that forms part of the moist linings known as mucous membranes or mucosa, which line various tubes in the body, such as the respiratory tract, the gastrointestinal tract, and the urogenital tract, are key early warning sentinels detecting invading pathogens through conserved pattern recognition receptors, such as toll-like receptors. Pathogen detecting populations, include cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system, including macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), which engulf and process microbial antigens and present the antigens to adaptive immune cells, thus providing initial signals to adaptive immune system lymphocytes to engage potent antigen-specific T and B cell responses.  Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are distributed throughout the human body in lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues, but are especially enriched at the mucosal barrier surfaces, where they directly interact with a number of different cell types; hematopoietic or other . ILCs have lymphoid-like morphology, but lack any antigen-specific receptors. Arising from a common lymphoid progenitor and similarly to T cells, they can be further subdivided into phenotypically and functionally distinct populations that produce different combinations of effector cytokines to mediate their functions. Their development depends on different transcription factors, which are also used to help divide ILCs into 5 main groups; group 1 ILCs that includes Natural Killer cells, as well as the non-cytotoxic ILC1s, group 2 ILCs or ILC2s, group 3 ILCs including ILC3s, group 4 containing lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells and, group 5 are regulatory ILCs or ILCregs.  The production of Interleukin-5 (IL-5) by ILC2s in the lung leads to eosinophil recruitment, and other cell populations interact and shape the presence of lung ILC2s in airway inflammation. In addition, they also promote proliferation of B cells. It seems, that the increase in ILC2s present correlates with the severity of inflammation in the lungs, intestines, kidneys and other organs of patients suffering from severe COVID-19, and evidence confirms some \u2018immunogen- experienced\u2019 ILC2s persist after the resolution of the initial inflammation, portraying similarities to memory T cells. So, people who have been previously exposed to other coronaviruses may carry some some \"Immunogen-experienced\" ILC2s in the in the immune compartment of their lamina propria, that can provide at least partial protection against SARS-CoV-2.  It has been shown in mice that Natural Killer cells (NK cells) and ILC1s inhibit ILC2 expansion due to the production of Interferon- Gamma, and therefore they (NK cells and non- cytotoxic group 1 Innate Lymphocyte Cells) may help prevent the development of severe COVID-19 disease.  I intend to support my thesis, that the primary obligatory weapon against SARS-COV-2 is our highly complex and ancient, innate immune system, and not the simple, modern adaptive immune system.

This was based both on animals trials and previous research on GS-441524. In some animals trials GS-441524 was compared directly with Remdesivir, as an anti coronavirus treatment, with GS-441524 becoming the preferred treatment.  Gilead developed Remdesivir with the FDA, however it is much more complicated and expensive to make than GS-441524 and could be less effective but for numerous reasons Gilead will make more money from Remdesivir and the FDA may also has a financial interest in remdesivir.  Critics say a long known promising Covid-19 treatment GS-441524 has not been studied and that it was delibrately blocked, for profit reasons, from Covid-19 researchers, having proper access to all the information on it.  Prior lab studies have shown that GS-441524 is effective against coronaviruses SARS, MERS and FIP a near 100% fatal cat coronavirus that GS-441524 had a near 100% cure rate for.  Gileads' responses have not addressed the points raised nor whether Gilead is promoting remdesivir because of its longer patent or why Gilead blocked and/or also had not encouraged or helped anyone researching the medical effectiveness of GS-441524 to resolve matters.  Gilead has for a some years also refused to explain why it has not allowed the manufacture or licensing of GS-441524 for use in cats after successful animal trials cured cats of a fatal coronavirus disease   Gilead should ditch remdesivir and focus on its simpler and safer ancestor Gilead has another antiviral that's easier to make and safer to use than remdesivir. Why isn't it giving that drug any attention? The world can only hope it isn't for the sake of protecting its intellectual property.  www.statnews.com  A journalist writing in The Atlantic said \"After Ebola trials in previous years found little benefit, remdesivir became a drug in search of a (human) disease.\"  Some years ago GS-441524 and Remdesivir were both tested against FIP a 95% fatal cat coronavirus.  Gilead was involved in these University of California animal tests providing the 25+ different drugs initially screened for use in the trials and credited in the published research.  The trials showed both remdesivir and GS-441524 were effective against FIP however GS-441524 was preferred and cured 100% of the coronavirus infected cats in the university tests. Later field tests on pet cats confirmed GS-441524s effectiveness  Strangely Gilead has refused to allow anyone to make or legally use GS-441524 on cats (or any animals or humans) despite repeated requests related to cats  Thus long before Covid-19 cat owners were forced to buy GS-441524 on the black market to treat their cats and Gilead did nothing nor provided any explaination  Critics say Gilead blocks GS-441524 as it is easier and cheaper to make and so will compete against Remdesivir meaning Gilead will make less money  Following Gileads and the FDAs focus on remdesivir and their failure to enter into meaningful discussions or research on GS-441524, an open letter was written to the FDA and Gilead by a citizens advocacy group asking  why GS-441524 was not being studied as a Covid-19 treatment and  that the FDA and others be encouraged to do research or  to explain why it was not scientifically and medically possible to do so.  The citizens group writing the letter has formally raised medical and other matters over many years, is non political and has been critical of both the Trump administration and the FDA and their response to covid-19 and other citizens rights matters. For example they separately launched legal action against the FDA over what is said to be an unsafe medical device that the FDA failed to withdraw.

Research indicates that GS-441524 is less toxic than remdesivir so can be given in higher doses and is much easier to make than remdesivir plus has many other benefits over remdesivir.

According to journalists and others Gilead has not responded to requests to clarify its position on allowing GS-441524 for the treatment for cats and seems unwilling to provide any meaningful response to requests for clarification on a range of matters about GS-441524 including encouraging meaningful covid-19 research. Gileads responses have focused on stressing remdesivir benefits or passing comments about any researching of GS-441524  Gilead and the FDA jointly developed the drug Remdesivir however Gilead registered the patent without including any FDA rights though later published research papers clearly list the many government scientists involved   Coronavirus Susceptibility to the Antiviral Remdesivir (GS-5734) Is Mediated by the Viral Polymerase and the Proofreading Exoribonuclease Emerging coronaviruses (CoVs) cause severe disease in humans, but no approved therapeutics are available.

Two of the molecules worked marvelously in cat cells infected with the FIP virus: GS-441524 and GS-5734, the latter of which is now better known as remdesivir.  After Ebola trials found little benefit, remdesivir became a drug in search of a (human) disease.  Both molecules were effective, so Pedersen decided to pursue the simpler one, GS-441524. He then infected 10 cats with FIP and dosed them with GS-441524. All 10 cats recovered.  \u201cWe almost fell out of our chairs,\u201d says Weigner.  in a follow-up field trial of 31 pets with naturally acquired FIP, 25 ultimately made it\u2014an unheard-of recovery rate.  Despite the success, Gilead refused to license GS-441524 for use in cats.  While Pedersen was testing GS-441524 in cats, a different virus\u2014a human virus\u2014was raging halfway around the world in West Africa: Ebola. The virus that causes Ebola is not a coronavirus, but remdesivir is unusually broad-acting for an antiviral, and early results against Ebola were promising. So promising, in fact, that the company was eyeing FDA approval of remdesivir in humans.  According to Pedersen, Gilead worried that the cat research could impede the approval process for remdesivir. Because GS-441524 and remdesivir are so similar, any adverse effects uncovered in cats might have to be reported and investigated to guarantee remdesivir\u2019s safety in humans.  Gilead\u2019s caution about generating unnecessary cat data is standard industry practice. \u201cOne of the rules in drug development is never perform a test you don\u2019t have to, if the results could be problematic,\u201d says Richard Sachleben, a retired pharma-industry researcher.  (Gilead declined to comment for this story.)   A Much-Hyped COVID-19 Drug Is Almost Identical to a Black-Market Cat Cure Cat owners are resorting to China\u2019s underground marketplace to buy antivirals for a feline coronavirus.  www.theatlantic.com   In search for COVID-19 treatments, consumer group pushes drugmaker Gilead to test alternative to remdesivir The pharmaceutical company that makes remdesivir \u2014 the only medication to receive emergency authorization to fight COVID-19 \u2014 should also be conducting human trials on a related drug with strong potential, according to a citizen advocacy group  www.chicagotribune.com   Pharmalot The U.S. government contributed research to a Gilead remdesivir patent \u2014 but didn\u2019t get credit By Ed Silverman @Pharmalot May 8, 2020  September 2015 in which Gilead sought a U.S. patent for a using the compound for any number of coronavirus infections. Although the code Gilead assigned to the compound \u2013 GS-5734 \u2013 does not appear in the body of the application, experts who have reviewed the chemical structure say the compound is remdesivir.  One month later, some of the same Gilead employees whose names appeared on the patent application were listed as co-authors on a Nature research paper \u2013 along with numerous government scientists \u2013 showing remdesivir, specifically, held promise in fighting Ebola and other coronaviruses. The paper also noted testing was conducted at high-risk security labs run by the federal government.  The role played by the federal government in developing remdesivir to combat coronaviruses has, in fact, involved various grants to universities, as well as contributions from government personnel at such agencies as the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, according to Knowledge Ecology International, an advocacy group that first disclosed these connections.  But while it remains unclear the extent to which federal funds contributed to the R&D, the patent is of particular interest because it is tangible evidence that government work yielded something of potential financial value to the company. Yet government employees are not listed as inventors, which one expert suggested should be corrected, especially in an era when federally financed research might be leveraged to collect royalties or, arguably, lower the price of medicines.  \u201cIn this case, all of these scientists were really working together very intimately on research that led to the molecule,\u201d said Arti Rai, a Duke University law professor who specializes in intellectual property and a former U.S. Patent and Trademark Office official, who is researching remdesivir patents and the role played by the federal government.  \u201cGilead actually had a huge number of patents on the molecules, but had to do a tremendous amount of work to figure out which variations of the various molecules would work against the biological models the government had. This patent illustrates the essence of why collaboration between the public and private sectors is important, not just in terms of money, such as grants, but resources.\u201d  \u201cWhat really matters is how much money the government has put into research, but if their names were on there, it would help to make the case there was a lot of in-kind contribution from the government,\u201d she explained. \u201cRight now, if Gilead tried to assert rights (in response to a patent challenge), there would be no way to know there was some government right to a license to the patent.\u201d  Generally, one must play connect the dots to find government assistance. For instance, the National Institutes of Health gave grants to several universities whose researchers worked with Gilead scientists. Their efforts appeared in a 2018 paper in the American Society for Microbiology, which found remdesivir can combat coronaviruses, noted Tahir Amin, who heads the Initiative for Medicines, Access, and Knowledge, an advocacy group that challenged various Gilead patents on hepatitis C medicines.  We asked Gilead, which several months ago sought to add claims to the patent, for comment and will update you accordingly.  Numerous consumer advocates, academics, and lawmakers have argued that prescription drugs invented with taxpayer dollars should be affordable to Americans. Public Citizen estimated that U.S. taxpayers contributed $70.5 million to remdesivir R&D overall.  \u201cSince we\u2019re paying for the research, we shouldn\u2019t expect to be at disadvantage,\u201d said Jamie Love of Knowledge Ecology International. \u201cThe argument that you have to have a high price because a company made big investments is harder to justify when there was a large public financing role in the R&D. A high company may say a high price is necessary, but the rationale falls apart when we\u2019re paying for the R&D.\u201d  Gilead has often been at the center of such debates. As noted previously, the drug maker and the federal government filed dueling lawsuits over patents that formed the basis of a best-selling HIV prevention pill called Truvada. The government claims Gilead should pay royalties on its patents, which stemmed, in part, from taxpayer funding, while the company has argued the government patents are invalid.   The U.S. government contributed research to a Gilead remdesivir patent \u2014 but didn't get credit \"This patent illustrates the essence of why collaboration between the public and private sectors is important,\" said Duke University law professor Arti Rai.  www.statnews.com  Feb 2020 news article on GS-441524 By Dr. Joette Giovinco  Dr. Joette Giovinco wrote a press article highlighting GS-441524 in Feb 2020 as a promising Covid-19 treatment   Feline coronavirus treatment could stop spread of COVID-19 in humans, doctor says A drug used to treat a type of coronavirus that only affects cats could be the key to treating COVID-19, the human coronavirus spreading across the world.  www.fox13news.com    Remdesivir is a promising antiviral drug and works by inhibiting the activity of RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp).  GS-441524 is a feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) inhibitor and a predominant metabolite of Remdesivir that is superior to Remdesivir against COVID-19.  First GS-441524 shows comparable efficacy in cell-based models of primary human lung and cat cells infected with the coronavirus. GS-441524 could strongly inhibit feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), with an EC50of 0.78 \u03bcM.  Recent research in coronavirus-infected nonhuman primates demonstrated problems with remdesivir that inadvertently showed the antiviral effectiveness of GS-441524. In multiple studies testing remdesivir in coronavirus-infected mice or rhesus macaques, it was rapidly converted to GS-441524 in the bloodstream..... injection of remdesivir in NHP results in GS-441524 being present in serum at concentrations 1000-fold higher than remdesivir throughout a 7-day treatment course (Figure 3b).  Last but not the least, GS-441524 is capable of treating cats suffering from feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) with a 96% cure rate. Importantly, coupled with the robust antiviral activity of GS-441524 against FIP, these data compel further investigations into the therapeutic and prophylactic utility of GS-441524 against SARS-CoV-2.  All in all, GS-441524, a FIPV inhibitor, is a predominant metabolite of Remdesivir and superior to Remdesivir against COVID-19.    https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsmedchemlett.0c00316   GS-441524, a FIPV Inhibitor and the Predominant Metabolite of Remdesivir, is More Effective Against Covid-19 - Immune System Research GS-441524, a potent FIPV inhibitor, is a predominant metabolite of Remdesivir and superior to Remdesivir against COVID-19.  www.immune-system-research.com   Gilead should ditch remdesivir and focus on its simpler and safer ancestor Gilead has another antiviral that's easier to make and safer to use than remdesivir.

However this drug GC376 was much less successful than GS-441524  The researchers of GC376 are clearly very good and professional  However how is it Covid-19 treatment research can be done on GC376 with cat coronavirus FIP treatment effectiveness being cited as one of the reasons for rapid research, and yet this not happen on GS-441524 when its almost 100% effective against the cat coronavirus FIP and worked well against other coronaviruses plus GS-441524 is potentially better than remdesivir ?  antiviral GC376 out of Kansas State University had previously been tested but only seven out of 20 cats had gone into remission. Those results seemed impressive at the time, but GS-441524 appeared to be even better  \"Relapses no longer responsive to treatment occurred in 13 of these 19 cats within 1-7 weeks of initial or repeat treatment(s).

Analogs of these drugs also inhibited the MERS CoV Mpro and blocked viral replication in cells at an EC50 of 0.5\u2009\u03bcM14. Our studies show GC376 and GC373 to be effective inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, in agreement with previous studies showing GC373 and GC376 possess broad specificity against the Mpro of coronaviruses and calciviruses (Supplementary Table 2)10,13,14,22. Clearly, these drugs need to be advanced quickly into human trials for COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of COVID-19 and is a virus with a significant mutation rate23. Also, in some patients the virus has persisted longer than 2 months with some possibility of re-infection24. Vaccines are critically important, but still likely a year or more away as this virus may present vaccine challenges.

Although antigen tests are not as accurate as the PCR tests, Mina said that problem could be solved by requiring a second test using a different type of antigen test to confirm original results.  It is highly unlikely that different types of antigen test would also produce a false positive  If enough people were provided with the tests and used them frequently, they\u2019d know if they were contagious and could then isolate themselves to avoid spreading COVID-19 to others.  Mina cited the example of Slovakia, \u201cwhere massive screening has, in two weeks, completely turned the epidemic around.\u201d He said that even if only half the U.S. population used the tests, outbreaks could still be stopped in a matter of weeks.  Although antigen tests are not as accurate as the PCR tests, Mina said that problem could be solved by requiring a second test to confirm original results.

Mink are farmed in the cold to promote fur growth and their caged status results in very low metabolic rates which produces an almost constant state of below normal body temperature or hypothermia. The caged bats in the cold outdoor Wuhan markets were also likely hypothermic because of their inability to fly and produce heat from the high metabolic efforts of flight. Both animal groups were therefore likely hypothermic when fighting the zoonotic coronavirus and their immune systems might have been unable to handle their infections. This might put a new light on the fact that the vast majority of human COVID deaths around the world are mostly happening to sedentary seniors, diabetics and respiratory ventilator patients that all suffer a form of hypothermia in core body or lung temperatures. Workers in refrigerated conditions like the meat industry as well as colder seasonal temperatures are also likely causing people to experience some form of mild hypothermia that may be contributing to the second wave of COVID infections. Maybe it is time to investigate the idea that literally every aspect of COVID-19 has some form of hypothermia related to it while the people least affected by it are almost hyperthermic with their high metabolisms and ability to produce fevers.

But what happens to them when you put them into a cage and keep them in a cold Wuhan Market? They get very sick and contagious because they have been robbed of the one thing that they have always used to cure themselves, the heat/fever of flight.  Now enter humans into the equation, similarly children and young adults have strong core body temperatures, very high metabolic rates and can easily generate heat/fever enough to fight viral pathogens very similar to a bat that is free to fly. Take away that strong core body temperature, high metabolism and ability to generate heat/fever with age, inactivity, sickness and misguided treatments and you have exactly the same conditions of that of a bat in a cage. Sedentary seniors, diabetics, ventilator patients and people taking fever reducing medications, ALL have one thing in common, they all have reduced metabolic abilities to maintain strong body temperatures and/or they have impaired their ability to produce enough heat/fever to cure themselves and they are dying by the hundreds of thousands. If a bat can cure COVID-19 with a Hyperthermic Treatment of Flight, surely we should at least be giving heat/fever a try to treat humans.

I\u2019d like to make the case for Virally Acquired Adenosine Deaminase Deficiency and closely associated enzyme irregularities in Covid-19.  The enzymes I propose to be involved are closely biologically or physically coupled. DPPIV/CD26 is membrane bound by Adenosine Deaminase 2 whilst the latter is closely biologically coupled to the activities of Glucose 6 Phosphate Dehydrogenase. Adenosine status regulates all three. I propose the problem can be explained by Acquired Adenosine Deaminase Deficiency (which could be because the virus retains the ability to target DPPIV which is membrane bound by Adenosine Deaminase 2 as per SARS and MERS). Did we take our eye off the ball as soon as ACE2 became implicated as a receptor?  Blacks and Asians have a high incidence of Glucose 6 phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency and the UK \u2018BAME\u2019 population are 3x more likely to be admitted to hospital even though the smoke half as much as Whites and Mixed. G6PD Deficiency promotes endothelial oxidative stress and decreased endothelial vasodilatory Nitric Oxide availability (note Nitric Oxide showing promise as a therapy). G6PD is also deeply implicated in Kawasaki Disease, (for example: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4834672/) as associated with Covid-19 in children and the Lividoid rash common to both. G6PD is one step away from Adenosine Deaminase which also results in platelet abnormalities. Both enzymes cause a condition called Severe Combined Immune Deficiency. Lack of DPPIV (also known as CD26 and is an Angiotensin Converting Enzyme) can lead to vascular permeability because it does not deactivate Substance P (or Bradykinin responsible for cough).  I have put together a basic video (below) to draw attention to DPPIV/CD26 and Adenosine Deaminase 2 as \u2018Ground Zero\u2019. No dispute that ACE2 is involved and disruption would certainly also reduce the expression and activity of DPPIV. Adenosine receptors also produce surfactant in Alveoli and a back-up in processing Adenosine Diphosphate would explain low platelet count and aggregation.  Perhaps the most interesting point of all is that Adenosine converts to Inosine only in Hypoxic conditions and it serves as a key counter-regulator of hypoxia. This appears mostly due to vascular tone and a direct effect on levels of 2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate which facilitates Haemogloin release of oxygen to hypoxic tissues. It appears severe covid-19 patients are relying upon an evolutionary-conserved bio-mechanism that ordinarily isn\u2019t needed because Adenosine Deaminase serves that function without need to reach hypoxic levels.  The biology is entirely related to respiration, oxidative stress control, electron transport, inflammation and Immune modulation. DPPIV/ CD26 and Adenosine Deaminase are the perfect place to start if you wanted to engineer a disease like Covid-19. I\u2019m not supportive of the idea that it has been bio-engineered but if there were only one enzyme one could attack it would have to be Adenosine Deaminase 2 because DPPIV/CD26 also depends upon it and it has other effects, the second choice would be ACE2. Type 2 Diabetics have a head start because they tend to be taking DPPIV inhibitors already and have other related glucose and hypertensive issues.

Of course, without knowing the exact symptoms of coronavirus, you won\u2019t be able to distinguish it from other illnesses. It doesn\u2019t exactly announce itself with a nametag. As the virus spreads from country to country, it\u2019s important to know how to spot the symptoms both in yourself and in those close to you. Here\u2019s a look at the symptoms of the coronavirus.     1. Common symptoms are fever, shortness of breath, and coughing. Coronavirus is a respiratory illness, so the symptoms will mostly affect your respiratory system. Coughing and shortness of breath are the most common, and a fever will generally accompany these. Don\u2019t panic if you have these symptoms though, because they can apply to other illnesses as well.  2. Symptoms can appear anywhere from 2 to 14 days after exposure. When monitoring symptoms, keep in mind the time frame that they appear within. If you suspect you\u2019ve been exposed to someone who could have the virus, symptoms can appear between 2 and 14 days afterward. For comparison, influenza symptoms are usually apparent 1-4 days after exposure. The longer incubation time might help coronavirus spread, since those who are infected don\u2019t know they are yet and can still be contagious even without symptoms.     3. You might not be able to distinguish between flu symptoms and coronavirus. One challenge when diagnosing coronavirus is that its symptoms are very close to the flu. Both are respiratory illnesses, and both can cause fever and shortness of breath. So, if you have flu-like symptoms, it\u2019s wise to stay home, avoid contact with others, and work on getting better with rest, hydration, and fever-reducing medication. Keep in mind that about 80% of coronavirus cases have been mild. Even if you do get it, chances are, you\u2019re going to be fine. \u00a0", "responseCount": "6", "postDate": "1600733932", "id": 128}, {"source": "https://forums.livescience.com/threads/question-about-overlap-between-5-day-test-results-window-and-possibility-of-being-contagious-due-to-recent-exposure-after-testing.3486/", "question_title": "Question about overlap between 5 day test results window and possibility of being contagious due to recent exposure after testing.", "question_text": "Question: If I were to get tested as a precaution 5 days before visiting someone (Test results window is 3-5 days), then hypothetically get exposed to the virus sometime during that 5 day window (or maybe even a few days before testing if it takes awhile after getting exposed to show the markers that would result in a positive test), then what is the risk of being contagious if I were to visit someone on day 5 and hypothetically be in the pre-symptomatic stages at that point?

The only difference between a mild case of this flu and a lethal case of this flu is how far down the respiratory tract it goes, with pneumonia in the lungs being the most severe. Research shows that the optimal temperature for the replication of human based cold/flu viruses is 33C and colder and it is normally limited to the upper respiratory tract because of the higher temperatures of the lower respiratory tract. Research and correlation suggests that the zoonotic coronavirus that causes COVID-19 comes from an animal with a core body temperature of 40C (3C higher than humans) and indicates that the optimal temperature for replication could be as high as 35C to 36C and colder. Although the temperature of the human lower respiratory tract and lungs is normally close to 37C, there are a number of factors that can cause it to drop low enough to allow the zoonotic coronavirus to replicate optimally and cause life threatening pneumonia. The current objective of social distancing is to eliminate the exposure of humans to the coronavirus virus, however if you can keep the lower respiratory tract and lungs warm enough, you should be able to prevent or lessen the severity of COVID-19 if exposure does occur. Support for this theory comes from the animal world in which the transitionary animal for the zoonotic coronavirus, the \u201cbat\u201d, survives this virus with a self inflicted Hyperthermic Treatment of it\u2019s own, a flight induced fever.  PROPOSAL: The only weapon we currently have left against COVID-19 is HEAT and I don\u2019t mean as a cure, I mean as a reduction in severity or in some cases even prevention. The only difference between a mild case of the flu and a lethal case of the flu is how far down the respiratory tract they go, with pneumonia in the lungs being the most severe. Research shows that the optimal temperature for the replication of the human cold viruses is 33C and colder. The higher temperatures of the lower respiratory tract keep this virus from replicating deeper into the tract and most cold viruses are limited to the nose and throat. It is believed that the zoonotic coronavirus that causes COVID-19 originates in an animal with a core body temperature of 40C and therefore has a higher temperature for optimal replication in the range of 36C and colder and can penetrate further into the lower respiratory tract and even into the lungs IF the temperature drops low enough. The temperature gradient within a humans respiratory tract is dependent on three factors, your core body temperature, your ability to produce a fever and finally the temperature of the air you are breathing and how you take it in. Human core body temperatures are generally around 37C but can go as low as 35C in seniors (making seniors automatically the most at risk to severe cases of COVID-19. Younger healthy humans can achieve fevers safely to a temperature of 40C, while many seniors are unable to achieve a fever at all. It is also the norm for humans these days to regularly take fever reducing medications to bring down their fevers. The final factor of the temperature of the air we breath in is in fact a result of our lifestyle within the environment of our seasonal cold weather that we live in. On the extreme end of a very cold respiratory tract we have cold weather athletes breathing high volumes of extremely cold air, through their mouths for extended periods of time that can bring lung temperatures low enough to damage them (frostbite has even been suggested). Not as severe but still with temperatures low enough to be in the danger zone, we have people working, commuting or taking brisk walks/runs in very cool weather for extended times and not always dressed to keep their bodies warm. The point here is that you don\u2019t have to be a senior, with an already low core body temperature to be susceptible to a severe case of COVID-19, if your activities cause your lower respiratory tract temperature to drop low enough to allow the replication of coronavirus in your lungs, you are going to get very sick.  Take a look at the environmental conditions in Wuhan China, with outdoor markets and cold living conditions that people were working and living in. How about Northern Italy, with the European lifestyle of going out in the cold every day to the shops exposing themselves to colder living conditions and possibly colder respiratory tracts, with a resulting mortality rate of over 10%. How about New York, a cold spring with thousands outdoors working, commuting, exercising in the cold air driving down their respiratory track temperatures. Take a look at Australia, just coming out of a warm summer, they still have over 5000 cases, but the warmer weather has reduced the mortality rate to less than 0.5%, people will still get sick but generally with much severe cases. What needs to be done is the recent history of as many patients as possible to be taken to get an idea of exposure to cold. Patient \u201cvitals\u201d should show patients with low body temperatures and the outcomes of their illness.  The idea of heat being a weapon against a virus has not escaped the animal world either. The following is a Veterinarian Article that suggests that the body temperature of many species of bats while flying is likely high enough to reduce virus replication and allow bats to better survive viral infections.  Bat Flight and Elevated Body Temperatures Canale and Henry \u201cThe heat of fever forestalls pathogen replication and increases the efficiency of the immune responses. Such body warming is associated with shortened disease duration and improved survival in most animals.\u201d Although fever has been associated with improved recovery, very little is known about mechanisms, including whether the impact involves thresholds or average rates of immune response. During fever, mammalian core body temperatures can vary but typically are 38\u00b0C\u201341\u00b0C (14). The high metabolic demands of bat flight results in core body temperatures that commonly reach the ranges of core temperatures typical of fever. High body temperatures during flight have been demonstrated in multiple species of bats within several families and such high body temperature ranges increase the rate of multiple immune responses in mammals, including components of the innate and adaptive immune systems. Daily high body temperatures thus might arm bats against some pathogens during the early stages of infection.\u201d  All the evidence is there, the only way to fight this Coronavirus without a viable antiviral drug or vaccine is HEAT. DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO KEEP YOUR BODY AND YOUR RESPIRATORY TRACT AS WARM AS POSSIBLE. STAY INSIDE WERE THE AIR IS WARM TO BREATH, DO NOT TAKE FEVER REDUCING MEDICATIONS, TURN UP THE HEAT ON RESPIRATORS, EXPLORE HYPERTHERMIC TREATMENT, ANYTHING THAT WILL PREVENT YOUR LUNGS FROM GETTING COLD ENOUGH TO ALLOW REPLICATION OF THE CORONAVIRUS. \u00a0", "responseCount": "4", "postDate": "1598550234", "id": 130}, {"source": "https://forums.livescience.com/threads/did-i-get-the-pfizer-vaccine-or-the-placebo.3307/", "question_title": "Did I get the Pfizer vaccine or the placebo?", "question_text": "So, I got my first injection in the Pfizer study yesterday.

Abstract\u200b This unfinished paper is to start a discussion on an alternative model for protecting humanity from COVID-19. By itself COVID-19 poses enormous moral and ethical challenges. The model presented in this paper poses its own additional moral and ethical challenges, some of which will be addressed herein. One of the most critical challenges of all is the time required until the World\u2019s population is sufficiently protected from COVID-19. The time required impacts lives and suffering not only from the disease itself but also from the social and economic consequences of our current efforts to protect the World\u2019s population. The economic consequences are not merely an abstract construct, but impact lives and suffering by the loss of the ability to meet basic human needs for food, shelter and education. Most COVID-19 research focuses on the production of antivirals and vaccinations. An alternative approach is to infect the population with a different disease, such as one of the common human coronaviruses, 229E, NL63, OC43 or HKU1. This could allow people to produce the helper T cells that would fight COVID-19, creating immunity on a faster timeline than vaccination production and distribution. The COVID-19 challenges far exceed the abilities of any one group or person. As a Systems Engineer, Computer Scientist and Applied Mathematician this is a request for collaboration from people and teams with the expertise and resources to address these unique challenges.  A Comparison of Competitive Disease Propagation and Vaccination Models\u200b Inoculating a sufficient portion of the World\u2019s population with a vaccine to directly and indirectly, through herd immunity, protect humanity against COVID-19 is the gold standard but is not the only approach. One can imagine multiple ways to inoculate humanity for protection from COVID-19. Another approach would be to infect a sufficient portion of the World\u2019s population with a minor disease that as a side effect provided some immunity to COVID-19. Vaccination with its individual delivery to each person provides greater control over the inoculation process and consequently lower risks. But this control comes at the cost of producing and distributing individual vaccines. Vaccination has at best a linear time, O( n ), production rate limitation to inoculate humanity. Infecting the World\u2019s population with a disease gives up the individual control over the process with consequently higher risks. In exchange, it can at best achieve exponential spreading through the population and thus a Log time, O(Log( n )) complexity. A Vaccination Model At a high level Vaccination against COVID-19 consists of Discovering or developing a vaccine, Testing in animal models, Testing in humans, Clinical trials, Developing a production process, Constructing factories and supply chains to produce the vaccine, and Developing world-wide transportation and distribution systems to inoculate a sufficient portion of the World\u2019s population to protect humanity against COVID-19. A Competitive Disease Propagation Model At a high level Competitive Disease Propagation against COVID-19 consists of Discovering or developing a disease, Testing in animal models, Testing in humans, Clinical trials, Developing an infection process, and Developing world-wide education and infection networks to inoculate a sufficient portion of the World\u2019s population to protect humanity against COVID-19. A Comparison of the Models Comparing these two models shows many similar steps, with the similar steps taking comparable amounts of time. The key differences are that the Vaccination Model requires Constructing factories and supply chains, and Developing world-wide transportation and distribution systems, while the Competitive Disease Propagation Model requires Developing world-wide education and infection networks. These key differences affect how the two models scale to inoculate a sufficient portion of the World\u2019s population to protect humanity against COVID-19. For the Vaccination model, the complexity of producing inoculations scales linearly, O( n ), for the number of inoculations required. The complexity of the transportation and distribution system is O(nLog( n )) or higher. For the Competitive Disease Propagation model, the complexity is O(Log( n )) for the number of inoculations required. To put numbers to this, conservatively assume that 6 Billion people or 75% of the World\u2019s nearly 8 Billion population, need inoculations for adequate protection. A total combined global factory production capacity of 1 Million doses per day requires 6000 days or nearly 16.5 years to produce the inoculations. A competitive disease with a duration of one week and an R0 of 10 would require 10 weeks to produce the inoculations. While these numbers are arbitrarily chosen, they illustrate the way linear vaccine production and exponential disease spreading could possibly scale. To see this from another point of view, consider the number of inoculations produced per week for the two models.  Week\u200b \t 1\u200b \t 2\u200b \t 3\u200b \t 4\u200b \t 5\u200b \t 6\u200b \t 7\u200b \t 8\u200b \t 9\u200b   Vaccination\u200b \t 7x10^6\u200b \t 14x10^6\u200b \t 21x10^6\u200b \t 28x10^6\u200b \t 35x10^6\u200b \t 42x10^6\u200b \t 49x10^6\u200b \t 56x10^6\u200b \t 63x10^6\u200b   Competitive Disease Propagation\u200b \t 10^1\u200b \t 10^2\u200b \t 10^3\u200b \t 10^4\u200b \t 10^5\u200b \t 10^6\u200b \t 10^7\u200b \t 10^8\u200b \t 10^9\u200b  Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, Chief Scientist for the World Health Organization, believes an optimistic scenario is a vaccine produced in the tens of Millions in 2021, as quoted by Ars Technica. In addition to the time required for protection, these models also differ vastly in the type of resources required from the World\u2019s health-care systems. A competitive disease propagation model literally replaces the bioreactors and purifiers from the vaccine factories with people. It replaces the world-wide transportation and distribution systems with people. The impact of this difference in countries with weaker health-care systems is enormous. A competitive disease propagation model works with the resources we have.  What Characteristics Would a Competitive Disease Require?\u200b A Competitive Disease would need to meet a few Goldilocks requirements. It must have sufficiently mild symptoms to minimize direct harm to people. It must be sufficiently contagious to spread rapidly through the World\u2019s population. It must then convey sufficient protection against COVID-19 to make COVID-19 no longer an overbearing threat to humanity. Shane Crotty and Alessandro Sette, Immunologists at The La Jolla Institute for Immunology, as well Andreas Thiel\u2019s team at the Charit\u00e9 University Hospital in Berlin both have identified the presence of helper T cells that recognize and target the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The La Jolla team has detected a similar presence in approximately 50% of blood samples collected between 2015 and 2018, while the Berlin team found 34% of analyzed blood samples from uninfected people also contained these helper T cells. The La Jolla researchers speculate these helper T cells were triggered by past infection with one of the other four coronaviruses that cause colds. One or more these four common cold coronaviruses could be candidates for a competitive disease. The infectiousness of a pathogen can vary greatly with the behavior of a host. Just as social distancing and isolation can reduce the infectiousness of COVID-19, a cooperative effort between infected and uninfected people could boost R0 enormously. For a common cold type disease with respiratory droplet transmission, an R0 of 10 or even 100 is not out of the question. How Do We Spread the Disease? There are a range of possibilities. One method might be using throat swabs from an infected to an uninfected person. Another method might be for an infected person to intentionally cough on another, perhaps coughing into an open mouth or while the other person is inhaling.  What Could Possibly Go Wrong?\u200b At the scale discussed herein, the question is how could anything not go wrong? The following is a short list of things that could go wrong and some possible mitigations. Expanding this list and mitigating these problems is a crucial part of making a competitive disease model ethically, morally and practically possible. The Spread of the Competitive Disease Could be Contaminated with COVID-19. Mitigating this risk will require testing, monitoring and tracking. This is a massive quality control issue that must be carefully addressed. The Spread of the Competitive Disease Could be Contaminated with other Diseases. As above, this is a massive quality control issue. One approach would be to isolate the desired disease and seed populations around the World. From there the disease can be spread from human to human. The smaller the infection hot spots are, the fewer diseases we inadvertently carry along. The Competitive Disease Could Mutate into a More Dangerous Strain. We are fortunate that coronaviruses mutate at a lower rate than other human pathogens, such as influenza. Maximizing R0 and minimizing the size infection hot spots would both reduce the number of and risk from mutations. The idea is to keep the family tree of the disease as wide and as flat as possible. Mutations are most significant on long paths from the root to the leaves of the tree. Perhaps we should call this \u201cFlattening the Tree\u201d? Seeding populations with the competitive disease allows a tradeoff between the performance and risks of the two models. At one extreme, large hot spots provide the pure competitive disease model, with its higher risks and higher speed. At the other extreme, small hot spots provide the lower risks and lower speed of the vaccination model.  What Comes Next?\u200b How Do We Start? Using an existing disease, such as one of the common human coronaviruses, endemic to the population, with mild symptoms simplifies some of the moral and ethical challenges. We are not releasing an unknown pathogen. We are, however, intentionally increasing the probability of people\u2019s exposure. Weighing the pros and cons of such a proposal should consider that spreading an existing disease is a lesser risk to the population than letting COVID -19 continue along its course until a vaccine can be produced and distributed in sufficient quantities. Where Do We Go? We need to confirm the assumed safety and efficacy of such an approach with one of the common human coronaviruses. We need to quantify the logistics requirements. There are vulnerable groups that must be protected, just as there are with COVID-19. But the potential costs and savings in human lives requires attention. A discussion between people and teams who have the potential resources and interest in this model should begin. Please consider this proposal and share your comments on the challenges and opportunities presented by a Competitive Disease Model for protecting humanity from COVID-19.

Maybe they would need more and larger doses to build up enough memory B-cells to ward off a large infection later.  Could this approach be practical in a very short time from now? Shorter than current vaccine efforts because we already have the virus to treat with?  I realize this is probably a very naive question and the answer will be, yeah, that\u2019s already how it works, and it just takes time to develop dose(s) and schedule.

In discussing COVID-19 exposure, treatments and vaccines, people refer to establishing immunity against SARS-CoV-2, without clarifying how they are using the term immunity. What this virus does to the body with various symptoms and how patients are treated and recover eventually leads to some type of immunity. Immunity may be temporary and last for days, weeks, months or years such as the flu. Or immunity may last a lifetime such as with measles. As an aside, measles has the ability to wipe away 20-50% immunity to previous diseases leaving a person vulnerable to previous diseases for which they once had immunity. So how immune am I? When someone has immunity to COVID-19 this means different things to different people. When the WHO said having COVID-19 doesn\u2019t mean you could never get it again the press jumped on that. What people hear, what they read, who they talk to and what research is being pushed through the media have been influencing people\u2019s perception of immunity. There are degrees of immunity. If you get infected with the same virus again it could be just as bad as the first time, you could get infected but have a milder case, it could be so mild you don\u2019t even know you have it but you are still contagious and are spreading it to others, or you may never get infected again. There are no guarantees as everyone\u2019s body reacts differently and this virus attacks differently. Many people believe if they get infected again it won\u2019t be too bad because our bodies would be able to fight it before it gets out of hand. Do you think if you have immunity you are safe to be around vulnerable people because you can\u2019t infect them? What degree of immunity would allow you to feel safe around others? There is no guarantee you would not shed virus and be contagious again, and whether this is related to the degree of immunity you have. What types of immunity are there? Natural Active Immunity occurs when we are exposed to a pathogen, develop a disease and then develop immunity against it such as measles, mumps, or influenza. This is also known as Adaptive Immunity and is unique to vertebrates. Natural Passive Immunity occurs during pregnancy when antibodies are passed from mother to fetus through the placenta or through breast milk to an infant. This is temporary and helps infants fight infections for the first few weeks or months of life until its own immune system is fully developed. Breast feeding, when possible, is really important to the health of an infant. Natural Passive Immunity is also used when someone receives medical injections of gamma globulins. Artificial Immunity occurs when the body is given immunity by providing intentional exposure to a disease with small quantities or parts of the pathogen, such as with a live vaccine or a killed vaccine. This occurs with diseases such as measles and the flu. You can develop immunity against the measles or influenza by receiving the vaccines or by being exposed to the diseases. We know immunity to measles is for a lifetime, whether you are exposed to the pathogen and develop the disease or you receive a vaccination, whereas immunity to the flu lasts for about a year whether you get the flu vaccine or get the flu. In either case of the flu you are open to getting it again the following year. How Does Immunity Develop? We are born with innate immunity, a non-specific combination of physical, chemical, and cellular defenses to prevent pathogens from entering our body. Think of tears when you get something in your eye, sneezing or coughing when you get something in your nose or lungs, and fevers. Other organisms in nature also have innate immunity, think of plants that are poisonous to eat or the tentacles of a jellyfish. Our white blood cells, known as leukocytes, are either phagocytes that surround and absorb pathogens and effectively eat them or they are lymphocytes known as B and T cells. The adaptive immune system involves the production of B and T cells. These cells are both made in the bone marrow but must mature to become activated. The letters represent where in the body these cells mature, B cells mature in the bone marrow while T cells are transported and mature in the thymus gland. As B cells or T cells are produced, they are cloned to specifically target the pathogen they have detected. Once matured they live longer in our bodies providing that long-term immunity we all hope for, so we don\u2019t get infected with the same disease twice. As B cells produce antibodies, these remain in our blood and provide protection from future infections. B cells fight bacteria and viruses by making antibodies which lock onto their target and hang on until other immune cells can destroy the invader. There are two types of T cells, Helper T cells and Killer T cells. Just as the names imply, Helper T cells communicate with other cells particularly triggering the B cells to produce antibodies and alerting other leukocytes, while Killer T cells destroy cells that have already been infected. Yes, they kill our own cells to get rid of invaders and work particularly well fighting viruses. Distinctions Without Value If you have a similar disease to let\u2019s say COVID-19 and get cross immunity from a different pathogen is that natural or is that artificial? Does it matter? What Does Matter How long immunity lasts and the degree to which it protects you does matter. Understanding the type of immunity and what triggers each is critical to understanding why an alternative to vaccination with a competitive disease could be beneficial against SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.

I'm trying to work out the level of risk of catching coronavirus in my apartment block. The actual apartments are sealed off from one another (apparently) though I always know when my neighbour downstairs has made toast! But I'm not worried about that, she's 85 and staying home for the whole of this crisis.  What I'm wondering about, is there's a window I long to open, especially now as it's getting hot, but to the left and right of it, about 3 - 4 metres away, are the bathroom windows of my neighbours. Not something that's ever bothered me before, but I know that when people flush toilets, any germs are aerosilised, so would fly out of their open sky light windows and maybe travel through my window. Maybe not a problem if I was nowhere near the window, but I'm a metre from it sat at a desk.  Of course all this is assuming a neighbour has the infection, but just wondering, would you have it open at a time like this? I have other windows but they don't seem to bring in the breeze as much as this one.  Also would you use a portable air conditioner during this pandemic. I imagine the concern there is for others rather than for myself as the air con extracts hot air into the street below. There are people walking by about 2 - 3 metres down. You cannot feel the hot air from the street at all, it disperses before then, but I'm thinking of viral particles (that's assuming there's infection in my home, I'm not ill but I don't want to add to this pandemic by pumping virus out of my windows, so just looking for considered scientific answers). Also wondering if the way air con operates it is swirling air around my apartment and therefore it may move germs about for me inside. I don't think my apartment is particularly well sealed off from my immediate neighbour. When he goes in and out of his front door he is literally standing in front of mine with only about a foot from him and the door. So I have assumed that my front door is a riskier area and I don't stand near it, etc, only go there if I'm going out or coming in. So I don't really want swirling air around my apartment if the risk is considered to be high right now.  If it's felt that either of these things carry significant risk then it's simple, I won't do them. I'll put up with it for as long as necessary, but I'm just wondering if I'm being a little bit ocd as other people don't seem to worry so much and they all have their windows open.

IF that is the case then there Has to be Something Other Than Antibodies that is stopping it, because 80% of the people getting infected are Not getting COVID Pneumonia. So Why are they spending 100% of their efforts developing a \u201cvaccine\u201d that Only Works with antibodies when 80% of the population already has \u201cSomething Else\u201d that works against the disease.  So what is this \u201csomething else\u201d? WHY aren\u2019t the Experts researching what has been \u201cworking\u201d for 80% of those infected. What about the one thing All COVID Pneumonia Patients have in common? The Evidence is Overwhelming, the people getting very sick or dying from COVID-19 pneumonia Are either sedentary seniors with already very low core body temperatures Or people that are constantly being exposed to colder outdoor seasonal temperatures long enough to reduce lower respiratory tract temperatures to that of seniors. The seasonality of colds and flu for most of us in higher latitudes is most acute in spring and fall because those are the seasons we push to be out side with warm cloths on to keep warm But Without Thought as to the cold air we breath into our respiratory tracts and how much we lower our lung temperatures. Quite simply if it is cold enough outside to wear a jacket it is cold enough to affect your lung temperature.  Viruses that cause respiratory infections are Limited to the respiratory tract for one reason and one reason only, it is the only internal part of the human body that is constantly below our core body temperature of 37C. All Human Respiratory viruses only replicate optimally at temperatures below 34C. The Whole reason they are seasonal is because of seasonal temperature swings of the air we breath. The novel coronavirus is especially deadly because it is zoonotic and come from an animal with a core body temperature of 40C and can replicate at higher temperature than human derived viruses but its replication is still limited by a body core temperature of 37C.  Sedentary Seniors have core body temperatures of 35C to 36C simply because of low metabolic rates. They are the hardest hit because there is nothing stopping the novel coronavirus from runaway replication in their colder lungs which can rapidly overwhelm them and cause lethal pneumonia. Their ability to produce a fever is very slight and it seems Institutions these days are reluctant to turn up the heat for environmental reasons. Seniors\u2019 survival rates are very low because there has not been any effective treatment available for them.  Next, those People that are continually exposed to seasonal moderately cold air temperatures that live, commute and work outside for extended periods of time long enough to lower their lung temperatures enough to allow the coronavirus to rapidly replicate in their lower respiratory tracts. Coastal environments and cultural lifestyles all encourage their people into conditions that will lower their respiratory tract temperatures. A new group of workers working in refrigerated environments like the meat industry are also emerging as being extremely vulnerable to \u201ccold lungs\u201d with COVID pneumonia rates almost as high as seniors care homes.  And Finally, we have those People that are unfortunately infected and unwittingly taking fever reducing medications that are actually suppressing our body\u2019s only initial immune defences And reducing the body\u2019s ability to warm up their lungs. And the final nail in the proverbial coffin however Is only partially heated ventilators that are delivering air/oxygen mixtures directly to patient lungs Below 37C degrees and further cooling the lungs and Promoting virus replication. That is why survival rates on ventilators is so low, they are actually cooling the lungs.  It is time to stop looking at infection numbers and start looking at mortality numbers, just who is getting the sickest and who is dying. Yes there are exceptions, but the overwhelming majority of people with COVID pneumonia have One very obvious thing in common, Cold Lungs. So what can be done, first off turn up the damn thermostats in Seniors Care Facilities and at least give them a fighting chance. Daily Hyperthermic Treatments might also reduce the severity of the disease. Outdoor and refrigeration exposed workers should be taking extra precautions to keep their respiratory tract temperatures warmer and exposure times less. Infected patients should stop taking fever reducing medications unless absolutely necessary and for God\u2019s Sake turn up the temperature on the ventilators.  ALL the \u201cExperts\u201d have been so focused on immunity and antibodies and vaccines that they have overlooked the obvious, IF the temperature within the respiratory tract is high enough, the Novel Coronavirus Can Not Replicate and Therefore Can Not Cause COVID-19. \u00a0", "responseCount": "6", "postDate": "1589315350", "id": 163}, {"source": "https://forums.livescience.com/threads/the-case-for-herd-immunity.2341/", "question_title": "The case for herd immunity", "question_text": "Let's take a look at our current strategy for fighting Covid 19. We've decided we're going to fight this contagion by \"playing it safe.\" And inso doing, we can only assume that if any given state who has just relaxed its restrictions finds its cases increasing substantially (and who knows what that means, our leaders never bother telling us) then they will go back and clamp down on the current easing and presumably return to the same lockdowns that characterized the first month and a half or so of the outbreak with hopes of keeping the disease spread to a minimum until a vaccine or effective treatment can be developed.  Sounds good, so what's the problem with playing it safe?  1. Economic: You don't need an economist to tell you that by shutting down most of the economy, we're in for an economic crash not seen since, well, it takes us back beyond The Great Depression. Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson had to go all the way back to the early part of the 1700s to find a collapse of comparable magnitude. The implications of which are multifold. Livelihoods and dreams in ruins: countless businesses have and will continue to shut down, turning the carefully cultivated futures of literally millions of people to ashes. Long-term unemployment for people living paycheck-to-paycheck resulting in bankruptcies of astounding magnitude, shaking the very foundations of our society.  2. The psychological impact of isolation and loss of income: The Washington Post just ran an article titled (and which requires no further explanation), \"The coronavirus pandemic is pushing America into a mental-health crisis. Anxiety and depression are rising. The U.S. is ill-prepared, with some clinics already on the brink of collapse.\" (https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/05/04/mental-health-coronavirus/)  And people forced to live with each other day in and day out is not a healthy situation. How many domestic violence cases will occur? How many relationships will end? How many irretrievable words will be exchanged between otherwise well-coexisting people? (Personally, if I had to live side-by-side with Jesus Christ for months on end, eventually I'm not so sure one of us wouldn't end up dead.)  3. The unintended death toll: Besides a rise in expected suicides, The International Food Policy Institute just estimated that the economic toll on the world's economy will double the 147 million people living in extreme poverty, likely resulting in millions of deaths through hunger. (https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hunger-crisis-coronavirus-pandemic/)  With all of this in mind the otherwise sound advice of, \"Listen to your doctor,\" by in this case shutting down the economy, makes a physician's words seem myopic. Doctors are not trained to think in these terms. They aren't trained to see the big picture. They see a sick patient and their number one concern is to make them healthy at whatever cost. And our legal system only reinforces this by imposing staggering fines on any doctor that might have forgotten. Unfortunately in all of this it's the Hippocratic Oath itself, \"do no harm,\" that is being forgotten.  So what happens if we \"go reckless\" and remove restrictions on ourselves and our economies? If instead of trying to keep the pandemic's spread to an absolute minimum, we allow most of us to get the disease? A false argument currently exists that assumes we either shut down everything when under a pandemic's stress or we let 'er rip, best stated by a forestry official's famous quote while Yellowstone Park was in flames during the late 70s: \"Burn baby, burn!\" Nobody seems to be talking about focusing on better protecting that small percentage of the population that runs a high risk of ending up in a hospital's care while allowing the rest of society to contract the disease, get over it, and get back to work. While estimates vary as to how many people need to be infected and consequently become immune to the disease in order to stop it from spreading, 75% might seem a reasonable assumption. At this point as you may already know, we reach what is referred to as, \"herd immunity,\" when enough people are immune to keep a disease from spreading. But can we even handle an acceleration of infections?  Hospital Supplies  As far as hospital supplies are concerned, it's anybody's guess. We hear about shortages of various hospital supplies, but other than usual anecdotal reports, researching it I was unable to get any idea of exactly what was needed when and where, nor do I doubt anybody can currently answer that question. But I do believe it is not unreasonable to assume that hospital supplies like what one hospital in my state has requested:  Unscented hand lotion Simple elastic headbands with buttons for masks Surgical caps with ties and buttons near the ears (NOT the bouffant style) N95 masks Hand sanitizer Non-latex gloves (any size) New digital thermometers can't be compensated for by either simple improvisation (bullets 1, 2, 3, 5), making do with latex for those not allergic (6) and simply sterilizing what you have (which could apply to many of these.) An N95 mask is nothing other than a basic cloth mask with a small filter fixed to the front that filters out 95 percent of particulate matter in the environment and which under normal conditions can be picked up at the hardware store. Can't these masks be sanitized and the filter strips replaced? I can't believe that in an emergency (like one with the potential for creating a scenario described above) that any of these shortages can't be made up for or accommodated by alternate means. And if they are shortages, by how much and under what conditions? I think this might be taking the adage, \"for lack of a nail, a war was lost,\" a little too far.  This thinking may sound simplistic, but I find myself forced to answer the issue of shortages in such a way since none of these questions seem to be getting adequately addressed by anyone. Other than the usual vague information our media and leaders get away with under normal circumstances, when the issues so profoundly effect our lives more than ever we deserve better, more complete answers to these questions provided to the best of their ability. Instead, we're forced to guess our way around things or trust they have them under control. (And we all know where that can lead us.) And if the people who should know don't know, do we assume these possible shortages can't be dealt with while knowing what's about to hit us through prolonged quarantines?  As for ventilators. it turns out that they were in all probability being over used to begin with resulting in more deaths since ventilation requires sedating the patent, which works to weaken them in other ways. (https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/08/doctors-say-ventilators-overused-for-covid-19/)  Hospital Facilities  Despite what the news media depicts of a nationwide hospital system at the verge of collapse, with the exception of the densest urban area hospitals during the hight of the crisis, the vast majority of our hospitals are currently way under utilized. How do we determine that for our particular state? Since the total number of patients currently hospitalized in every state isn't always available, we can get a pretty good idea by totaling the number of confirmed cases in any state admitted over the last 10 days (being the average time spent in hospital for covid-19 patient) from the list provided here (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:COVID-19_pandemic_data/United_States_medical_cases) then dividing that by the average percent hospitalized. Here in New Hampshire it's currently 11% where we are currently treating 107 patients. (https://www.nh.gov/covid19/)  In the meantime like in many states, New Hampshire has set up temporary emergency facilities, which alone totaled 1400 beds. Knowing these beds would be used for covid-19 patients, presumably they are equipped with the necessary facilities to handle these kinds of cases. If only these beds were counted as being usable to treat covid-19 patients, that would still allow for 140 hospital admissions per day (X 10 days average stay = accommodating 1400 patients at a time). But this does not mean the state can only handle 1400 people sick with covid-19 at any given time, it is that many sick who require hospitalization. And what is the true number of infections that represents? Since we know that in New Hampshire 11% of those testing positive for covid-19 are admitted to a hospital, approximately 1300 would have tested positive with 140 of those being admitted.  The current antibody tests can give us an idea of how many people are or have been infected with covid-19. We would probably have more results to compare but the powers that be determined we are better off with no information than some information and so put a stop to quick release of results before extensive peer review takes place. (Like they have all the time in the world and they haven't already used far less complete information to insist we abide by the most draconian resolutions.) The most reported on result (and perhaps the most reliable) being New York State's recent study that found a conservative interpretation of the figure to be 10.7 times the number of confirmed infections to actually be infected. (https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-york-antibody-study-early-results)  Thirteen hundred cases per day testing positive would indicate that about 14,000 had actually been infected (1300 X 10.7). So those 1400 temporary emergency hospital beds represent 140 potential patients testing positive and being admitted per day amongst the 1300 that tested positive, among the 14,000 who were actually infected per day. So if these emergency facilities alone can handle the nursing requirements of 14,000 new total infections in New Hampshire per day, that would therefore accommodate about 420,000 per month (14,000 X 30 days) of the actual total number of infections. The total population of New Hampshire is 1.3 million, meaning under the hypothetical condition that these emergency beds were the only ones available in the state, they could handle 75% saturation of infection amongst the population and allow us to reach herd immunity in as little as 70 days. Of course the infection rate would be in the shape of a curve meaning it would be impossible to calibrate infections to stretch evenly over this time period; however, if we wanted to conclude the pandemic within anything near 70 days--unless you live in a densely packed city that hasn't already been hard-hit--the problem will probably be getting that many people infected that quickly, not keeping them from being infected. If the system appears to be approaching strain, a temporary imposition of shut-downs and increased social distancing can be imposed depending on local conditions.  Get Sick Now, Do It for Grandma  All of those numbers on hospital capabilities assumes the percentage of hospital admissions to actual infections stays the same. But if we were to opt for this quick \"in-and-out\" approach we could then ask for and provide extraordinary protective measures for the most vulnerable to hospitalization--knowing they would only be subject to its confines and the rest of us to its cost--for a limited period before herd immunity could be achieved amongst the general population. Instead of the battle cry being, \"Stay home and keep Grandma from getting sick,\" it could instead be, \"Get sick, do it now, do it for Grandma.\" In this way, the outbreak could be over and done with before the next flu season comes around (which could begin anytime from October on and which hospitalizes up to .25% of the population) making now the best time to get started before the hospitals start to fill up. A strong argument might be made that this system would actually save lives and save the economy rather than take more lives. Meanwhile the current \"safe\" drip . . . drip . . . drip method could end up costing more lives in the end than it saves through forcing the most vulnerable to live in a contagious environment for longer periods, through increased suicides and general shortening of lives through hardship, to out-and-out mass starvation amongst the world's very most vulnerable--and claiming these particular lives at a far younger age than could otherwise have been. Couple that with a near guarantee of crippling the world's economy and the \"safe\" play starts looking like it deserves to be questioned.  While it seems to be part of the human condition to resort to \"what ifs\" of forecasted eventualities in order to justify playing it safe, allow me to give you one scenario about maintaining our attempt to keep the population \"safe\" from contracting this virus. What if ten years from now a new strain of coronavirus comes along that is far deadlier than this one and very few have the internal defenses capable of identifying it, and then combatting it? But if ten years from now it comes to pass and we've already had its ilk, those mostly elderly who are the most vulnerable today will in all likelihood have passed on and those who will be amongst the new vulnerable of tomorrow will at least have already had a similar virus. Perhaps it will be dealing with the devil we know today that will keep us alive tomorrow. \u00a0", "responseCount": "2", "postDate": "1589238110", "id": 164}, {"source": "https://forums.livescience.com/threads/coronavirus-spike-protein-just-mapped-leading-way-to-vaccine.907/", "question_title": "Coronavirus 'spike' protein just mapped, leading way to vaccine", "question_text": "The coronavirus uses this protein to invade human cells.

I don't know if the public at large thought that if we social distanced ourselves the virus would eventually go away. No, that is not the point of social distancing. Social distancing was meant as a measure to help prevent our healthcare system from being overwhelmed. The actual act of of social distancing is preventing us from really moving forward with battling the virus. That's not to say that all social distancing measures should be removed right now, it's just saying that the longer a population uses social distance as their primary means to battle this virus... the longer you're going to be practicing social distancing.  A few things to look at before going in-depth with all of this:  Why are 80% of the people that are being tested coming back as negative (don't have the virus) in all of the molecular (active) tests? I don't have anything to compare this to and I'd love to know how this stacks up against other viruses and diseases testing. This may in fact be the expected behavior. But just the number... seems high to me. Are we testing too many people that don't need to be tested? Is the virus not that contagious? Is this molecular test really that accurate? Are we double dipping too much in the number of tests administered? Are unique individuals being tested twice, thrice, or even more often? Keep in mind... just because an individual tests negative for the virus, that doesn't mean they won't contract it later. It just seems to me that a lot of people are being tested and coming back as negative.  The governments (United States) of the country have been ridiculed for their lack of response to this. Some of that is warranted. Although, from best I can tell, the ridicule comes from the lack of these molecular tests. But I would argue that the ridicule should be aimed at the lack of planning in response to this virus. A widespread molecular test would only be feasible if you could test EVERYONE in the country at the same time. That would be 320 million+ tests all done at largely the same time. This was never going to be possible - the governments (federal, state, local) should have realized that this was never going to be feasible. Instead the goal of the government should have been focusing on reliable antibodies testing. Money should have been thrown at developing and testing a reliable antibodies test so that you could push that testing out widespread, 6 to 8 weeks after this all started. Antibodies testing may or may not mean immunity... but it would at the very least tell you how widespread the virus has reached. If a percent of your population has the antibodies but never experienced any symptoms or had very mild symptoms, then that would alleviate some of the fear that goes along with this virus. And just to note, the fact that 80% of people that are being tested come back negative for this virus would seem to contradict some of the antibodies studies that suggest that this virus is more widespread, that is something that needs to be studied.  Further the governments should have recognized that basing this test at a state level was much to broad. A state level test might work in the smaller states of New England, but as you get more and more out towards the Midwest, the testing needs to be a bit more finer. Doing it by county is much too small (there are over 3,000 counties in the United States). I would suggest doing it by US congressional districts - mainly because these are already defined. It's not exactly fair to take a state like Texas and treat it all as one. Is it fair to the residents of Pecos, TX to have to suffer through restrictions because the number of cases are high in Houston? This is another miss from how the governments should have been planning for this.  Just to be clear, this is not a political issue. I'm not saying either party is to blame for this. There are states with governors from both parties and none of them would appear to have done any planning like this. I'm saying the governments as a whole failed in this planning. But also to be fair... hindsight is 20/20.  The problem we are facing right now is an extreme lack of data. We've social distanced ourselves to the point that no new data is coming in. Are people immune to it? Is the virus as contagious as we once believed? Are the symptoms that bad? We're not going to get any new information until we change things up a bit.  Now, seeing as how a widespread reliable antibodies test is probably not viable - at least in the short term, how can this situation be remedied? I would focus my attention to the percentage of hospitalizations of confirmed cases. Or if you really wanted to take it a step further, the number of people in the ICU of confirmed cases. The number of confirmed cases isn't telling us a whole lot right now. You can have a confirmed cases, but not affected by it very much. You could have a case of the virus, but not be confirmed (because you didn't get tested). You could have a case of the virus and not be showing any symptoms. You could have had the virus weeks ago and be recovered. But if you're in the hospital - or specifically in the ICU - and you have the virus, then you have a really bad case of the virus. That's not to say that it's peachy having it while you self-isolate at home. But if you've got it, and you're able to stay at home, then at worse it's probably like a really bad case of the flu.  Then to add on to this, I would again look at this data in terms of US congressional districts. Again, this would have ramifications in how to potentially treat a town like Pecos, TX vs. Houston, TX. If you've got a better way of dividing this up - I'm all ears.  I would also weigh in hospital capacity (or probably more specifically ICU capacity) in those divided areas and how much excess capacity those areas have.  All of this together would tell you which areas could potentially be opened back up. If an area has a relatively low percentage of hospitalizations - then it stands to reason that that area is not experiencing a widespread outbreak. If that area also has excess hospital and ICU capacity, then this would seem to be a prime area where things could be cautiously opened back up. That doesn't mean that an outbreak won't happen in that area. But that area would appear to have hospital capacity to treat people if the number of cases start to rise. And if a large outbreak then happens, it may require the area to be closed down again. But either way, it tells you something. It gives you more data that you can feed into the model about this virus.  To attempt to model some of this, I took data from the John Hopkins website - from April 21st - and tried my best to fit this into a useful display of information. There's a few deficiencies with the JHU data. Mainly, it doesn't give data for active cases in each state. It only gives information about confirmed cases in each state. It also does not give information about recovers in each state. Calculating active cases should be a simple matter of (confirmed cases - recovered cases - deaths). Also the JHU website lists deaths by counties or city and not so much by state. Since I don't have recovered cases and deaths for each state (and this could easily be a reporting issue and not necessarily with how JHU presents the information), what I did was took a percentage of active cases to confirmed cases from the total US population and applied that to each state's confirmed case number. (816,240 total US confirmed cases at the time I took this information, 44,228 deaths, 75,177 recovers ... subtract all of that out and you get 696,835 ... 696,835 divided by 816,240 equals about an 85% active case rate. Multiply each state's confirmed case by 0.85 to get a \"guess\" at how many active cases exist in each state. Kentucky had 3050 confirmed cases, multiplied by 0.85 equals 2603.83 \"active cases guess\"). This is fudging the math I know - but it's all I've got to work with. If there's a website that gives me the an accurate number of active cases and the number of active cases in the hospital for each state, that would definitely be preferable. I also took a snapshot of the hospitalizations from JHU for each state one day (April 16) and then again on a later date (April 21) and in some states the hospitalizations decreased... this told me that the hospitalizations figures JHU is reporting is a function of active cases and is not a growing number of total hospitalizations ever within the state - although I suppose that information could be a reporting issue explaining the reduction. The bottom line of it, I really need more accurate and better defined data to build this... but this is the best I've got. Also, some states did not report hospitalizations on the JHU website, so I had to remove them - I think Indiana was one such state - there were others but that's one I remember.  The information looks like this:   State\tActive (Guess)\tHospital\tPercent\t\tState\tActive (Guess)\tHospital\tPercent Kentucky\t2603.83\t1059\t40.67\t\tDistrict of Columbia\t2644.80\t402\t15.20 Wisconsin\t3948.42\t1211\t30.67\t\tArizona\t4487.12\t637\t14.20 Minnesota\t2191.48\t602\t27.47\t\tWyoming\t373.93\t52\t13.91 Oregon\t1710.84\t465\t27.18\t\tMichigan\t27888.25\t3374\t12.10 Maryland\t12116.75\t3158\t26.06\t\tTennessee\t6179.18\t730\t11.81 New York\t220566.24\t57103\t25.89\t\tConnecticut\t16916.33\t1919\t11.34 Ohio\t11717.22\t2653\t22.64\t\tMassachusetts\t33843.76\t3804\t11.24 Oklahoma\t2396.37\t541\t22.58\t\tHawaii\t498.57\t55\t11.03 Kansas\t1823.53\t405\t22.21\t\tIdaho\t1482.05\t157\t10.59 Georgia\t16972.68\t3702\t21.81\t\tDelaware\t2502.23\t256\t10.23 Colorado\t8631.90\t1880\t21.78\t\tWest Virginia\t775.17\t77\t9.93 South Carolina\t3789.63\t776\t20.48\t\tNorth Dakota\t549.79\t53\t9.64 Mississippi\t4026.11\t819\t20.34\t\tUtah\t2814.69\t268\t9.52 Virginia\t8221.26\t1581\t19.23\t\tNew Jersey\t76748.83\t6986\t9.10 Maine\t758.10\t138\t18.20\t\tPennsylvania\t30072.05\t2701\t8.98 Florida\t23472.85\t4172\t17.77\t\tLouisiana\t21218.19\t1794\t8.46 New Mexico\t1682.67\t291\t17.29\t\tTexas\t17302.21\t1411\t8.16 Arkansas\t1698.89\t291\t17.13\t\tRhode Island\t4695.42\t331\t7.05 Missouri\t5176.92\t873\t16.86\t\tVermont\t698.34\t49\t7.02 Alaska\t280.87\t46\t16.38\t\tIowa\t3108.37\t214\t6.88 Illinois\t28222.91\t4599\t16.30\t\tNorth Carolina\t6077.59\t373\t6.14 New Hampshire\t1235.32\t201\t16.27\t\tSouth Dakota\t1498.27\t87\t5.81 California\t28990.40\t4674\t16.12\t\tWashington\t10672.27\t503\t4.71 Alabama\t4466.63\t699\t15.65\t\tGuam\t116.11\t3\t2.58 Montana\t373.07\t57\t15.28\t\t\t\t\t  Now, looking at this table, this shows that Kentucky is actually faring pretty poorly with 40% of their cases being hospitalized. But also likewise, Washington state only has 4.71% of their cases in the hospital, but that's still 503 people. Does Washington state have the hospital capacity to handle 503 (presumably ICU) patients with excess capacity? (I really don't know). Again, this is probably why a more granular data set would be preferable... like US congressional districts, but this is the information I have to work with. I would arbitrarily consider any state that has less than 20% of their cases in the hospital and less than 100 total hospitalized would be areas that could potentially handle being opened up a bit. That would be the states of: Alaska, Montana, Wyoming, Hawaii, West Virginia, North Dakota, Vermont, South Dakota, and Guam (not a state, but the information was there). Maybe the \"under 100 total hospitalized\" is way too low... I don't know, I'd leave that up to people with a bit more knowledge of this information. And again, if this was divided up in congressional districts then this might yield different results. While the hospitalization rate in Kentucky is at 40% for the whole state, that might not be true for the far western end of the state where there's not a lot of densely populated areas. Again, I'm kind of assuming that all hospitalizations are ICU cases - that may not be the case and having a true number of ICU cases would probably be better.  As those states or areas open up, see what happens. Monitor those areas for 2 weeks or 4 weeks, what happens in those areas? No doubt the number of confirmed cases will likely go up, but to what degree? And is it manageable? And then you start to roll this out to other areas, which hopefully have seen their hospitalization numbers decrease while this monitoring is going on. Or hopefully you get reliable antibodies testing available by then and you could start to base this opening up on which areas have seen a widespread number of cases.  This would be what my plan for opening things up would look like. And this is where the lack of planning by the governments seem to be hurting. But I just don't see where the governments really had any plans to combat this. And again I want to point out that the actual numbers I used may not be the best numbers to use - but it's all I had. The logic behind using those numbers (whatever they might actually be) still remains the same. More accurate numbers is going to lead to a more accurate model. \u00a0", "responseCount": "6", "postDate": "1587755242", "id": 178}, {"source": "https://forums.livescience.com/threads/professor.2162/", "question_title": "Professor", "question_text": "Are you open to receive comments on Coronavirus?

(Dr.) Cameron J.L. Nelson, chief of DHA's occupational medicine branch, said, noting that this complies with guidance disseminated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"This guidance is especially important for families and others who may need to go out in public to perform essential tasks, such as food shopping,\" he added. The face-covering mask can be fashioned from simple household items such as a clean T-shirt or cloth, as demonstrated in CDC's do-it-yourself guide. Because surgical face masks and other personal protective equipment are in short supply in the health care arena across the United States, the CDC advises that homemade cloth face coverings should:  Fit snugly but comfortably against the side of the face; Be secured with ties or ear loops; Include multiple layers of fabric; Allow for breathing without restriction; and Be able to be laundered and machine dried without damage or change to the shape. CDC officials say cloth face coverings are especially critical in areas of significant community-based transmission. Using a simple cloth face covering not only can slow the spread of COVID-19, but also can help those who could unknowingly have the virus from spreading it to others, the CDC said. Cloth face coverings should not be placed on children younger than age 2, on anyone who has trouble breathing or who is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance, the CDC advises. Cloth face coverings should be washed routinely in a washing machine, CDC authorities said. When removing a used face cloth covering, the CDC says people should use caution and not touch their eyes, nose or mouth, and immediately wash their hands after taking the covering off. The CDC emphasizes that its recommendation on face cloth coverings complements, and does not replace, the President's Coronavirus Guidelines for America, 30 Days to Slow the Spread, which remains the cornerstone of the national effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus. CDC officials will make additional recommendations as the evidence for appropriate public-health measures continues to develop. \"Everyone must do their part to protect themselves and their families,\" Nelson said.

It was the fungus's I have listed below.  \u201cThermally Dimorphic Fungus\u2019s\u201d (TDF\u2019s) can exist in the form of both mold and yeast. What is unique about these particular types, is they respond to shifts in temperature by converting between hyphae (22\u201325\u00b0C) and yeast (37\u00b0C). This morphologic switch, known as the phase transition, defines the biology and lifestyle of these fungi.   Therefore, it is no coincidence that these types of fungi convert to yeasts once inside the hosts lungs, as the average internal body temperature of a human is 37\u00b0C.  A fungus is any member of the group of eukaryotic organisms. This includes yeasts, molds and mushrooms. Fungus are organisms that has their own classification of \u201clife kingdom\u201d which are separate from other eukaryotic life kingdoms like humans.  Most people think mushrooms, mold and yeast are plants, but they are all singled cell organism like us humans! In fact, humans are very similar genetically to fungi and more so than plants. In other words, the DNA in fungi more closely resembles the DNA of the inhabitants of the animal kingdom. We are nearly 100% alike as humans and equally closely related to mushrooms. This is the reason why the fungi's are able to chemically hide and do so much damage to humans.  Thermally Dimorphic fungi, cause infection following inhalation of spores (conidia) into the pulmonary system. Once in the lower respiratory tract, the conidia transform into the yeast phase by secreting enzymes, which is susceptible to phagocytosis by the pulmonary macrophages.  The action of the fungus's feeding on the human cells, is what causes the protein to evolve and that is how the disease(s) actually start. What the fungi's are doing inside the human, is exactly what they do on a forest floor as a mold.  When it is inside a human cell (Animal) and in the form of a yeast, the following is what it does (explanation from ENCYCLOP\u00c6DIA BRITANNICA ):  NOTE the budding process below is exactly the same as the COVID 19 VIRUS!!!!!!!!!  Asexual reproduction  Typically in asexual reproduction, a single individual gives rise to a genetic duplicate of the progenitor without a genetic contribution from another individual. Perhaps the simplest method of reproduction of fungi is by fragmentation of the thallus, the body of a fungus. Some yeasts, which are single-celled fungi, reproduce by simple cell division, or fission, in which one cell undergoes nuclear division and splits into two daughter cells; after some growth, these cells divide, and eventually a population of cells forms. In filamentous fungi the mycelium may fragment into a number of segments, each of which is capable of growing into a new individual. In the laboratory, fungi are commonly propagated on a layer of solid nutrient agar inoculated either with spores or with fragments of mycelium.  Budding, which is another method of asexual reproduction, occurs in most yeasts and in some filamentous fungi.  In this process, a bud develops on the surface of either the yeast cell or the hypha, with the cytoplasm of the bud being continuous with that of the parent cell.  The nucleus of the parent cell then divides; one of the daughter nuclei migrates into the bud, and the other remains in the parent cell.  The parent cell is capable of producing many buds over its surface by continuous synthesis of cytoplasm and repeated nuclear divisions. After a bud develops to a certain point and even before it is severed from the parent cell, it is itself capable of budding by the same process.  In this way, a chain of cells may be produced.  Eventually, the individual buds pinch off the parent cell and become individual yeast cells.  Buds that are pinched off a hypha of a filamentous fungus behave as spores; that is, they germinate, each giving rise to a structure called a germ tube, which develops into a new hypha.  Although fragmentation, fission, and budding are methods of asexual reproduction in a number of fungi, the majority reproduce asexually by the formation of spores. Spores that are produced asexually are often termed mitospores, and such spores are produced in a variety of ways.  Species of TDF  Several species of TDF, contain important pathogens of humans and other animals. The major human pathogens in this group are:  Blastomyces dermatiditis, Coccidioides immitis/posadasii, Histoplasma capsulatum, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis/lutzii, Sporothrix schenckii, and Talaromyces marneffei (formerly known as Penicillium marneffei).  The majority of these organisms are primary pathogens (as opposed to opportunistic), with the ability to cause disease in healthy humans who encounter them in endemic areas.  Whilst there are thousands of papers already published about the above, the thing that science is missing and why they are not finding a cure, is it is looking for the protein, but doing so in the wrong place.  I have already found several of the corona virus origin's within the above group and continue to cross check the protein bio's I have gathered against the latest data.  The most compelling evidence I have discovered so far, is nothing short of an exact match to the COVID 19 virus protein bio, which is distinctive in that it has multi-polar \"buds\" or\" spikes\" and resembles a ships wheel.  This is Paracoccidioides brasiliensis.  It's clinical manifestation is as follows (via Wikipedia):  P. brasiliensis causes mucous membrane ulceration of the mouth and nose with spreading through the lymphatic system. A hypothesis for entry of the fungus to the body is through periodontal membrane.[29][30] The route of infection is assumed to be inhalation following which the infective propagule gives rise to the distinctive multipolar budding yeast forms in the lung resembling a \"ship's wheel\" seen in histological sections.[9][31] Both immunologically normal and compromised people are at risk for infection.[9] The lungs, lymph nodes, and mucous membrane of the mouth are the most frequently infected tissues.[10]  Now look at the picture below.....      I have tweeted several heads of state, CNBC, CNN, BBC, SKY just so they can get the scientists to look at the data I have, but no replies.  I may be completely wrong, but why is it that I appear to be the only person on the planet who has joined all of the dots together and figured out in 7 days and nights, what science appears to have missed in over 50 years?  I am desperate to stop people getting and ill and dying and have been up for literally 7 days and nights to figure the answer out.  I am only interested in saving as many of the lives I can from all over the world so need some help to get this info out to the scientists and politicians.

From a young researcher who had been transferred from Shenzhen to Wuhan to collaborate with the task force that is fighting the coronavirus epidemic, we receive and willingly transmit to all of this clear, simple and accessible information, which describe exactly what it is. the virus, how it transfers from one person to another and how it can be neutralized in everyday life. The virus does not resist heat and dies if exposed to temperatures of 26-27 degrees: therefore often consume hot drinks such as tea, herbal tea and broth during the day, or simply hot water: hot liquids neutralize the virus and it is not difficult to drink them. Avoid drinking ice water or eating ice cubes or snow for those in the mountains (children)!  For those who can do it, expose yourself to the sun!  1. The virus crown is quite large (diameter about 400-500 nanometers), therefore any type of mask can stop it: in normal life, special masks are not needed.  On the other hand, the situation is different for doctors and health professionals who are exposed to heavy virus loads and have to use special equipment.  How it manifests itself:  1. The virus first installs itself in the throat, causing inflammation and a dry throat sensation: this symptom can last for 3/4 days.  2. the virus travels through the humidity present in the airways, descends into the trachea and installs in the lung, causing pneumonia. This step takes about 5/6 days.  3. Pneumonia occurs with high fever and difficulty breathing, it is not accompanied by the classic cold. But you may have the feeling of drowning. In this case, contact your doctor immediately.  The virus only survives on your hands for about ten minutes, but in ten minutes many things can happen: rub your eyes or scratch your nose for example, and allow the virus to enter your throat ...  You can gargle with a disinfectant solution that eliminates or minimizes the amount of virus that could enter your throat: in doing so, you eliminate it before it goes down into the trachea.  The new coronavirus NCP * may not show signs of infection for many days, * before which it cannot be known if a person is infected. But by the time you have a fever and / or cough and go to the hospital, your lungs are usually already in 50% fibrosis and it's too late!  Taiwanese experts suggest doing a simple check that we can do on our own every morning:  Take a deep breath and hold your breath for more than 10 seconds. If you successfully complete it without coughing, without discomfort, a sense of oppression, etc., this shows that there is no fibrosis in the lungs, indicating essentially no infection.  In such critical times, do this check every morning in a clean air environment!  These are serious and excellent advice from Japanese doctors who treat COVID-19 cases. Everyone should make sure that their mouth and throat are moist, never DRY. Drink a few sips of water at least every 15 minutes. WHY? Even if the virus gets into your mouth ... water or other liquids will sweep it away through the esophagus and into the stomach. Once in the belly ... Gastric acid in the stomach will kill all the virus. If you don't drink enough water more regularly ... the virus can get into your trumpets and lungs.

What do you think of the following solution to the Coronavirus (or any pandemic) problem:  1. To avoid transmission of the virus the Government should provide every person in this country with a protective suit (hazmat type) approved by the cdc to prevent the wearer from either giving or getting the virus (the disposable ones used in hospitals and labs plus gloves and masks together can be mass produced for less than $10, or perhaps design/develop an all inclusive suit that can be machine washable/reusable).  2. Law should be enacted (with criminal penalties) requiring all persons to wear the suit when they leave their homes for at least 3-4 weeks. This will allow people to resume a limited routine, working, shopping, without transmitting or receiving the virus. While out in public no one would be allowed to remove any protective equipment (mask, gloves, suit). That means that eating, drinking and using the restroom will only be allowed at home as well. This will be inconvenient and require planning (8 hour work shifts might have to be cut to 4 hours or give employees longer breaks to go back and forth from work to home and back). It is only temporary and will keep the virus out of the public domain.  3. Some would say that the problem with these suits is that one may be exposed if the protective suit is not removed properly (virus on the outside) however, my plan places everyone (not just health care workers) in a suit which reduces the likelihood that there will be any virus on the outside of the suit or protective equipment. Additionally, proper instruction and training for putting on, removing and sanitizing or disposing of the personal protective equipment would be provided by the government.  4. If anyone came down with the virus during the first 2 weeks while in the suit they could stay in their suits til they got to a treatment center or self quarantine at home.  5. After 3-4 weeks there should be no new cases of the virus.  6. The government could charge back the total cost with a $3 per week payroll tax split even between the employer (who benefits because his business didn't have to shut down) and the employee (who did not have to worry about getting sick). No need to panic, no stockpiling of food and supplies, no need to shut everything down. Even though no one likes the idea of imposing restrictions on our personal freedoms, the requirement of wearing a protective suit for a few weeks (kind of like a mandatory dress code) is far less restrictive than ordering a mandatory quarantine, and a whole lot better for the economy. Hospital and medical resources would not be overtaxed and lives will be saved by immediately shutting down the spread of this virus. If nothing else, it would buy enough time to develop an effective treatment/cure and vaccine.  Again, I don't know the logistics, and I can just imagine the argument that we don't have the ability to provide this amount of personal protective equipment (ppe). I assume that the logistics could be solved if leaders were sufficiently motivated to use all tools and authority necessary. Personally, I would put the military in charge of this effort and give them full authority to requisition any materials, production equipment, facilities or other resources necessary to get the job done immediately and let the government bean counters deal with compensation. We are currently doing piecemeal efforts conducted by city, state and local authorities, without a true comprehensive national plan, and settling for a solution that allows the virus to continue to escalate and ravage our country, eventually killing tens of thousands (or perhaps even millions) while we remain isolated at home. The cost of implementing this approach pales in comparison to the cost of the things we are currently spending money on (not to mention the fact that our economy is basically shut down). \u00a0", "responseCount": "20", "postDate": "1585808865", "id": 217}, {"source": "https://forums.livescience.com/threads/there-is-an-important-difference-between-disinfecting-and-sanitizing.1791/", "question_title": "There is an important difference between Disinfecting and Sanitizing.", "question_text": "With Covid-19 cases continuing to increase and the necessity of keeping things clean so that we can all be protected, I think its important that everyone understand the difference between Disinfecting and Sanitizing.

The trick is to do it safely, without unnecessarily risking chance of infection to yourself or spreading the virus to others. Since I'm heading off to the store later today, I figured I'd assemble some of what I've picked up as must have Do's and Don'ts on getting the supermarket grocery shopping done while staying safe.  FIRST - Go Only if You Must  First and foremost, go grocery shopping as little as possible. If you can limit your number of trips to the store, you'll limit your exposure. Go solo. Do not bring others with you unless you have to. Limiting exposure to just yourself reduces the chance of carrying the virus home or infecting others while out.   What to Bring  Bring hand sanitizer / germicide and use it on your hands and on the shopping cart before AND after you're finished shopping. Avoid handling cash if you can, bring and use credit or debit options. This reduces the amount of direct interactions you have to have with the checkout person. There are two schools of thought on reusable bags right now. There are bag shortages at some stores, so bringing them could be smart. But if you don't disinfect your bags, and don't plan on disinfecting them before you go to the store, leave them at home during the pandemic.   What to Buy  Look for shelf-stable nutritious foods that will keep a long time, and that make filling meals. Dried beans, pasta, canned goods, rice, legumes/beans, peanut butter are top priority. Don't hoard what you don't plan on using within 2 weeks. Grocery stores and pharmacies will remain operational. Try to buy what you can integrate into your usual routine, rather than unusual items that you'd not otherwise go for. Dry, cured meats, canned meats and fish, frozen vegetables and fruits are great additions. Freeze fresh meats for later use. Potatoes, carrots, and cabbage will last a long time in the refrigerator. Don't hoard water. Your tap and filters will still work perfectly fine. This isn't an earthquake or hurricane, the water will continue to flow to your home. Don't hoard toilet paper. You can do away with nearly all of your toilet paper by adding a bidet to your commode. Pick one up on relatively inexpensively from Amazon or one of the home improvement stores to install with a minimum of handiness. Treat yourself with a sparkling clean butt.   How to Shop for Groceries  Do not crowd the aisles. Be mindful and patient of where others are. Use the self-checkout option if it is available. Keep a minimum of 6 feet away from other people. Use the \"Two shopping cart\" rule, and don't come within two shopping cart's length of each other. This will require patience if someone is looking over food that you want to buy. If the store allows for pickup or delivery to your door or curbside, that's the most preferable. Be prepared to accept substitutes if your preferred brands are not available. Look, but don't touch! Don't touch anything in the grocery store / supermarket until you've decided affirmatively to buy it. You can assume that anything you pick up will have been touched by a minimum of 10 other people before you, just to get it on the shelves. For those in the United States, avoid purchasing items marked WIC - as these are items approved for the Women, Infants, Children program for low income families and there may not be substitutes. Be utmost kind and generous to the checkout cashier, stockers, and service staff. However rough this is for you, this is considerably more difficult for them.   When to Shop for Groceries  Go in the off-hours if you can. The fewer people present, the lower the chance of infection. Check with your local store for adjusted hours before you go. Many stores have limited their usual hours of operation due to the pandemic. If you do have your groceries delivered, don't do a direct hand-off. Instead, have them placed on your door step or into the car. For Deliveries, be patient as most services are experiencing very high demand.   After You Finish Shopping for Groceries  Wash your hands before you leave for the store. Use hand sanitizer or sanitizing wipes before you get in your car to drive away from the store. Wash your hands immediately upon returning home from the store. Before putting your food away, give it a once-over with a sanitizing wipe, or paper towel with disinfectant or soap. According to the BBC, Coronavirus can live on cardboard for up to 24 hours. Take that into account before shelving that box of Cheez-Its. Rinse the produce you buy with running water. For hard-skinned stuff, scrub. For leafy greens, a quick soak and rinse. Did you wash your hands? You cannot wash your hands enough. Wash your hands after you've put your shopping away. Follow these handy tips, and you should be better protected and safer during your trip to the local supermarket. Happy (and safe) shopping, friends!  -Joe  Edit: Updated to include the latest information on how to handle produce after purchasing. \u00a0", "responseCount": "9", "postDate": "1585451270", "id": 227}, {"source": "https://forums.livescience.com/threads/prognosis-for-restored-senses-of-smell-and-test.1623/", "question_title": "Prognosis for restored senses of smell and test?", "question_text": "Hello there.

However, with the exception of that, what is \"okay\" to do right now? Just for context, last I checked the province of Ontario had 189 confirmed cases (183 active cases, 5 recovered, and one death). It seems that almost all of those cases are in southern Ontario. I can't find official numbers on how many of those cases are in Toronto. According to CityNews Toronto, 92% of cases in Ontario are related to either travel outside of the country (29% of those being from the United States) or close contact with another confirmed case. There are some cases with mode of transmission listed as \"pending,\" meaning that as of right now, there is no known travel history or close-contact case to explain where it came from. All public schools in Ontario have been closed for two weeks (three weeks if you include this week's spring break). Additionally, effective today (March 17th) the City of Toronto has ordered the closure of all private schools, licensed childcare centres and cinemas, and dining in restaurants/bars is also prohibited (take-out and delivery is still allowed).  The situation here seems to have shifted very quickly and I am not entirely sure what is safe to do and what isn't.

I won't be doing that again- I can live without Starbucks- but I just want to know, as for other activities, where should I draw the line? Again, walking the dog is necessary, and of course I will likely need to go out and restock on food at some point, but with the exception of those two things, should I stay home at all costs, or are certain low-contact activities (going for an hour long walk, visiting a young and healthy close friend/relative, etc.) okay?

If the virus finds its way to your city, here\u2019s what you\u2019re going to need in order to ride it out and keep yourself and your loved ones safe.     1. Stock up on non-perishables. You don\u2019t have to turn into a doomsday prepper. The point of stocking up is to avoid being in contact with a lot of people. Instead of going grocery shopping multiple times a week, try to only go out once a week or preferably once a month to limit exposure. The less you\u2019re around potentially infected people, the better.     2. Keep your medicine cabinet well supplied. Just as with food, you want to make sure you have all the medicine you need so that you don\u2019t have to leave the house more than necessary. In addition to coronavirus, there are plenty of other illnesses making their rounds, so be ready to treat those. Cough medicine and fever-reducers are good options.  3. Make sure you have the appropriate cleaning supplies. Prevention is the best medicine, and one way to prevent the spread of germs is to keep your home clean. Bleach and disinfecting wipes have the potential to be deadly to coronavirus, so don\u2019t underestimate the power of simple household cleaning.

I started to wonder, if it is so complicated and time consuming, how did they ever develop the vaccine for small-pox back in the late 1800\u2019s?  So I looked it up and here is the crux of the discovery.    Smallpox vaccine, the first successful vaccine to be developed, was introduced by Edward Jenner in 1796. He followed up his observation that milkmaids who had previously caught cowpox did not later catch smallpox by showing that inoculated cowpox protected against inoculated smallpox.  (from another article on the manufacture of the vaccine) After calves had been inoculated with smallpox, the lymph containing white blood cells which fight against disease are extracted and preserved in capillary tubes. This is then used to vaccinate people against smallpox. Calf lymph replaced the human kind in 1898 as human lymph spread other infections, such as syphilis. The vaccine was made by the Jenner Institute for Calf Lymph Ltd.  Instead of spending millions and years of effort to develop a virtual vaccine, you would think those responsible would be harvesting the white blood cells from those who were infected and survived and using that to vaccinate people against Covid-19.  Now, I know that we have many smart researchers working on this problem and obiously they know some reason why this approach will not work in this and other similar cases.

The human immune system responds to most pathogens with a fever up to a limit of 40C before core body temperatures become dangerous and steps are taken to reduce it. Excess mucus flow is also triggered in an attempt to moisten the respiratory tract lining to help in fighting the pathogens as well. My point here is, the coronavirus is already associated with an animal with a core body temperature very near to that of a human\u2019s high fever point of 40C so maybe our fever is not quite high enough to fight a zoonotic virus. Why not give our immune system a helping hand with a heated steam ventilator to raise the respiratory track temperature even higher into the 43C to 46C range where it might be able to fight this higher temperature virus. It should be noted that human respiratory track temperatures** can be significantly increased without increasing the core body temperature and steam bathers easily tolerate temperatures of 46C. Breathing through the mouth can also increase the temperature reached and takes this artificially high fever directly to the location of the coronavirus which from all evidence is in fact heat sensitive. Even if it was used at the first sign of infection it could very easily reduce the severity of the virus. Humans have been successfully steaming themselves for years at home with a towel over a pot of boiled water as treatment for normal colds and flus*** so why not give it a try as a possible treatment for CLOVID-19, it certainly should not require any significant study to at least try it, the increased moisture of the steam might also help as well. Oh, and finally the best part of all, it\u2019s free and available around the world, a pot of boiled water, a large towel over your head and care not to burn yourself.  * It should also be noted that a high percentage of seniors (highest mortality rate from CLOVID-19) have core body temperatures of as low as 36C, 4 degrees lower than bats. Very mild cases have been recorded in dogs, body core temperature 38C. Everything points to temperature as the common factor. ** Although a human\u2019s core body temperature range is relatively limited around 37C, the human Respiratory Track is much more susceptible to changes in intake air temperature and can range from a normal 33-34C experienced at room temperature to as low as below 10C in some winter sport enthusiasts. Mouth breathing can reduce track temperatures even further. *** Most colds and flus start in the respiratory track and are especially more prevalent in colder dry seasons (and air conditioning) where it is the cooler dryer respiratory track that is much more susceptible to the viruses.  \u00a0", "responseCount": "1", "postDate": "1584145200", "id": 272}, {"source": "https://forums.livescience.com/threads/seasonal-flu-jag.1320/", "question_title": "seasonal flu jag", "question_text": "Here goes I had the seasonal flu jag on November 6th 2019 ,on Nov 14th i woke with a sore throat and sweating (fever ) later a headache sporadic coughing started 9hrs later , following day headache,slight fever ,sore throat gone but still had sporadic coughing fits throughout the day which started to get worse but became lethargic  The headaches sore throat and fever all stopped after 3rd day but the coughing stayed and i was getting more lethargic ,this went into the 2nd week and then the breathlessness started went to the doctors  who had took on a nurse that was dealing with all the after effects of the flu jag (her words not mine) i had cracklin in the lungs and given steroids and antibiotics (antibiotics are harder to get than herion in my area ), but by the amount of scripts she had written that rule must have changed  following week symptoms getting worse with my chest?breathing , given a stronger strain of antibiotics 3 weeks later cough gone , breathing better but still lethargic after 5 weeks still lethargic but felt ok  My sister ,mother and father all fell with the same symptoms exactly a week after getting the seasonal flu jag , and yes i know they tell you you don't get a flu but you do get a viral strain as such   So what i'm getting at is maybe this virus is contained in the seasonal flu jag maybe this is where researchers should be looking ,it's all fine and well saying it started in China , look how many europeans /westerners work/commute to china maybe it started iright at home in every county  My symptoms were exact same as the symptoms given by the WHO \u00a0", "responseCount": "2", "postDate": "1584136080", "id": 273}, {"source": "https://forums.livescience.com/threads/live-science-podcast-lifes-little-mysteries-special-report-coronavirus-march-12.1296/", "question_title": "Live Science podcast \"Life's Little Mysteries\" special report: Coronavirus (March 12)", "question_text": "In this special episode of Life's Little Mysteries, we'll give you the latest news and answer frequently asked questions about the new coronavirus and COVID-19.

Every year, about 56,000 people die from it (this is a rough estimate as it\u2019s notoriously difficult to track specifically flu-related deaths). With numbers like that, it\u2019s important to acknowledge that most other diseases that emerge are not quite so deadly. So, where does the coronavirus stand as far as comparisons with the flu?     1. The coronavirus doesn\u2019t seem to affect kids much. First and foremost, the flu is more serious when it infects children and those over 65. Weak immune systems are to blame for much of the severity, though even those who are healthy can be hit hard. So far, the coronavirus doesn\u2019t seem to infect children as much as the flu does. Kids who have been infected experience very mild symptoms, whereas the cases that are more serious tend to happen to those over 40.     2. When comparing death toll, the coronavirus has not been as deadly or serious. While we don\u2019t yet have yearly figures for the coronavirus (and to be honest we really don\u2019t want to get to that point), so far the death toll is at 2,770 worldwide, most of which occurred in China. The flu, on the other hand, hovers at over 300,000 deaths worldwide based on yearly averages.  3. We know less about the coronavirus. When discussing how dangerous a disease is, one aspect you have to take into consideration is how much we know about it. It stands to reason that a lesser known disease will be more dangerous simply because we can\u2019t anticipate the damage it might cause. The coronavirus is being seen in humans for the first time, and we don\u2019t even know which animal it originated in just yet. So, in this context, the coronavirus is more dangerous than the flu because we haven\u2019t been able to study it to the extent we\u2019ve studied influenza. Until we do, those unknowns are going to keep coronavirus at the top of the list of concerns. \u00a0", "responseCount": "1", "postDate": "1584031753", "id": 281}, {"source": "https://forums.livescience.com/threads/cruise-ship-with-apparent-coronavirus-outbreak-is-held-offshore-near-san-francisco.1200/", "question_title": "Cruise ship with apparent coronavirus outbreak is held offshore near San Francisco", "question_text": "A cruise ship with a suspected COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak is being kept in limbo near San Francisco Bay, where officials will screen people on board for the virus.

One hour after receiving my first vaccine shot, after sitting in my car all the hour, I stepped onto the parking lot to go shopping and felt the pain in my heel so strong that I couldn't walk!

I lived very far away from any doctors, so wanted to stay close to the vaccine clinic for a while longer to make sure I had no serious side effects.

My doctor suggested the vaccine caused inflammation and said to take tylenol if I needed it along with stretching, massage, icing and using arch supports.

My Mayo neurologist did not suggest any medication, but I did connect with a local neurologist who suggested I try Nurtec, which is taken at the first symptom and can work for my type of migraine. Medicare does not pay for it. I broke down and bought an 8-pack, at $100/pill, and keep one with me always.

Before this infection i only had gerd , gastroenterological problems (abdominal distensions, bloating, flatulence) and pharyngitis. 10 years ago i drank coke and i spit blood 2-3 times after stomacache and throatache. I did endoscopy then and i was diagnosed gerd. These gastroenterological problems cause excessive saliva. I was constantly spitting out my saliva. I also have benign fasciculations over 20 years especially when i have flatulence. These were all of my disorders before i had covid-19 infection. I didn\u2019t have any serious condition. In April 2021 i had covid infection. And after ten days i got diagnosed covid positive, my tongue kind of loosened after i drink water, i had need to relax (open) my mouth and stick my tongue out a little. And one other sympthom that occured during covid was involuntarily swallowing reflex (gulp reflex). By involuntary swallowing reflex (gulp reflex) i don\u2019t mean hiccups. Like hiccups, these are also involuntary but these are like swallows and causing sleeping problems, this reflex was keeping me awake every five minutes. And it also occurs when i am awake. These sympthoms are still ongoing. I am experiencing these sympthoms for 11 months! First 5 days of covid the only abnormalities were palpitations and mild shortness of breath. These days passed kind of normal. But I suddenly lost weight (10 kilograms) just in one week after 10 days my covid test came positive. My oxygen saturation was ok during covid. It did not go below %94. I did not hospitalized during covid. There wasn\u2019t any coughs or muscle-joint pain. But there were these problems next to gastroenterological problems like nausea, diarrea, loss of appetite and inflammation in my bowels. For example I was feeling like paralyzed when i was defecating during those weeks. I can not describe that feeling well but I guess there was neurologic involvement in temporal side. I was feeling dizzy. At that time I had diffusion brain MRI and there wasn\u2019t any finding. Everything seemed normal. One month after i tested positive i got better. I still had some problems with breathing but x-ray images of my lungs were ok. There wasn\u2019t serious pulmonary involvement. I got my appetite back. I could gain my weight back for a month.

No drugs, or special food or anything, just an inexpensive heart rate tracker and chairs in every room in my house. I have been a Long Hauler for 20 months and just recently started Occupational and Physical Therapy in January 2022. My occupational therapist suggested using a sit and rest technique when my heart rate reached 20-25 bpm more than my resting HR. So, I watch my heart rate on my phone tracker while doing any activity, and when my heart rate gets 20-25 bpm above my resting heart rate, I immediately sit down and do deep belly breathing until my heart rate lowers to 10 bpm above my resting heart rate. Then I get back up and continue doing the activity. If sitting and belly breathing does not lower my heart rate to 10 bpm above my resting heart rate within 3-4 minutes, then I lie down until the heart rate is settled. Then I get back up and start the task again. If I leave the house on an errand, I carry a small camp stool with me and use it in the store. It took two weeks to get myself trained to stick with it and be patient, but now six weeks later I have reduced my heart rate during the same activities by 65%. AND my fatigue is lessening too.

He said my lungs are okay, and the condition I have is throat/radiation related, and nothing at all to do with my past Covid illness in March 2020. He said I do not have COPD, or Emphysema. This whole ride has been a crazy one. Get this: I tested positive for long-term antibodies in February 2021. I assume that was indicative of having Covid back in March 2020, when the virulent cough broke 3 of my ribs, going on for months, then turning into constant thick mucus. In March 2021, I received both doses of the Pfizer vaccine. On April 4, I went to the local ER almost feeling horrible. I could barely walk two steps, was coughing up some wicked stuff, very sore throat, nausea, but the main thing was not being able to breathe. The hospital did a Covid test and it was negative. The ER doctor pumped me full of steroids, which helped my breathing\u2026that and my Primetene Mist spray sold over the counter, thank God. It has literally saved my life. Thank you God for leading me to it. Anyway, I told the doctor I had an appointment with a Covid \"Long-hauler\" Pulmonologist the next day, and had to go early as it is approximately 100 miles away. He said he would have admitted me but because my daughter was driving me down, he sent me home with steroids. The next day my condition worsened, and after the appointment with the Covid savvy doctor (and his totally conflicting lung x-ray/CT Scan reading results of my other Pulmonologist that claims I have COPD and Emphysema) was sent via wheelchair to their ER, to await a bed for admission. He wanted ENT's to scope me to see my throat, plus could barely breathe or walk. This hospital also tested me for Covid, and guess what? It came back positive. Okay! Here I am, with long-term antibodies, both vaccinations, and have Covid again. People ask, how do you know it wasn't false? The way I felt. I have never had such an illness that just takes everything away from you, such as this. I will be out of quarantine in a few days here at home, and slowly tapering off a ten-day course of Dexamethasone 4 mg. 3-x-a-day. The ENT's informed me that my vocal cords were paralyzed and I needed a trach-tube put in. Well, I called my speech pathologist and local Pulmonary doctor. Both informed me that if my vocal cords were frozen, I would have no \"gag-reflex\" and would not be able to talk. I brought this up to one ENT, and one hour before the surgery was to be performed, another ENT came into my room and told me I should just go home and recover. He thought the whole incident was Covid-related, and nothing to do with my vocal cords. He was an angel I believe. If I could name this crazy incident of my life in a Twilight Zone episode, it would be called, \"Escape from the Unreal.\" After spending 14 hours on a COT in the ER waiting for a bed, I was going to somehow try to leave, but knew my body would not comply because of the weakened state. Sorry to bore everyone, but thought you may want an update. So, yes, I am home-sweet-home for now. I sincerely hope everyone is well and fine. Please allow me to add one last thing! Believe it or not, I found a children's product with homeopathic-type ingredients that actually works wonders for me at dissolving mucus. You can buy it cheap on eBay too! Mucinex, no matter what strength, does absolutely nothing for me, yet, this miracle liquid really works. I hope it works for all of you fellow mucus-sufferers as well!!!

A further complication is that, in most facilities, communal activities and meals are also suspended to reduce contagion, so our loved ones are even more isolated.

I also have Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome which has me taking a steroid inhaler twice a day so I can breathe in the cold winter air. No asthma apparently but always get phlegm and coughy when I laugh hard or run a shorter distance. n<br/> <br/>I was picked up by an ambulance and brought to the emergency room earlier this week because it was hard to breathe. Basically I was panting because my body told me too and whenever I tried to slow down my breathing it feels like when you\u2019re holding your breath. The ambulance and emergency room found my O2 saturation at 100% and my blood gas showed signs of hyperventilation. Now this doesn't and didn\u2019t surprise me at all as I can feel that I am getting enough oxygen, as long as I am panting. The first time this happened during another infection I had pre-corona the emergency room all thought I was having a panic attack. That is absolutely not what is happening. I have had them in the past, they\u2019re completely different and don\u2019t last for 6-8 hours. n<br/> <br/>EKG was good. Blood gas good. As I managed to slow my breathing down more and more without feeling like I was going to suffocate my saturation sank and eventually the panting stopped completely and I had a saturation at 93-94%. According to the hospital staff, my saturation should still be bad even with the panting if that was the problem. I argue that my body obviously is panting for a reason. It\u2019s basically very laborsome to fill my lungs. n<br/> <br/>Am I missing something here? Is my logic really not valid? And what words am I supposed to use to explain how I feel to avoid the panic attack label? And why would I suddenly feel shortness of breath if I have no trouble saturating?n<br/> <br/>Thank you for reading this far.

I had extreme pain all over my body with sharp pressure points in several areas including my neck, throat, back/ shoulders, low back, elbows, knees, feet etc. I even had seizures for a few nights.

I don't understand why, given certain criteria and and mitigation strategies are satisfied, it is supposed be safe to send my younger child into a public classroom most of the day, every day, yet it is absolutely not safe to see my other child who just left home shortly before the pandemic, even rigorously using all the same mitigation strategies, and with community spread being equal. It just doesn't seem to add up.n<br/> <br/>To better frame my question_title, first consider my family still at home: Either my wife or I (not both) buys groceries once a week, at the time we believe is the least busy hour of the week. We carefully select and always use PPE based on the best information available. My son is in virtual school, and I work from home, except for rare occasions where it is necessary to go to work to perform my job, and then I follow strict social distancing and all the recommended Covid PPE and safety guidelines. We do get curbside pickup or go through the drive through a couple times a week. Otherwise, we never leave the house except for walks where we will not even be likely to encounter other pedestrians, or for essential doctor visits, or oddball one-off situations, like when we had to have a tire repair. Unfortunately this is against a backdrop of COVID-19 not being taken seriously in the surrounding community, with many acting as though there were no pandemic. Of course our strategies do really minimize encountering such people, but we can't reduce it to zero.n<br/> <br/>Now, I don't have a good feel as to whether we have reduced our risk 70%, 90%, 98%, or even to near zero compared to someone who does not take COVID-19 seriously. Do the experts have a good idea to what the risk would be to people with our lifestyle, or are we still at a point where there is still not enough research or information so that anyone really knows the answer to that question_title? If there is a good, evidence based estimate on how much the risk is reduced for a family like ours, what would that be?n<br/> <br/>And what is really the risk seeing family members you do not live with, given masks, social distancing, and other guidelines are adhered to? My personal prediction would be that it is less risky than buying groceries, but I would trust evidence that can be defended much more than my gut, and it really bothers me that an organization which is supposed to represent the gold standard for dispensing evidence based guidance makes both of those statements above without offering compelling justification as to why they should both be true", "postDate": 1614696883, "responseCount": 5, "source": "https://www.medhelp.org/posts/COVID19/COVID-19-Evaluating-the-risk/show/3063200", "id": 887}, {"question_title": "Gum Disease linked to Higher death rate with Covid 19", "question_text": "Recently it has been published that doctors note that those with gum disease die at a rate of 9 times more when they get covid 19.

The first time was in Jan 2021 and it lasted a month. I lost the sense of smell and taste for almost a month, couldn't breathe through my nose for over a week and stayed moderately congested for 2 additional weeks, had consistent fevers, chills, headaches and coughing for six days straight, couldn't eat for a week (my stomach hurt so badly, but I couldn't keep anything down and was too nauseous to try to eat), had a persistent sore throat for a week, and was dehydrated. However, the worst symptom was severe shoulder pain. I mean intense, felt like I was on fire, shoulder pain in both shoulders. My partner attempted to massage them for me once, but the slightest touch put me in tears. They burned so badly! The intensity lasted about 4 days, and slowly departed over the course of 2 weeks. I did go to the ER in the beginning (around day 2) because I couldnt breathe well and the shoulder pain was intense, but they said my O2 levels were good, my lungs were clear, and to go home and get rest. They prescribed Tessalon Pearls and Amoxicillin, and said to take OTC pain relievers for the shoulder pain.    Thereafter, I received 2 Moderna vaccinations, wore masks every day, used sanitizer and washed my hands regularly, and didn't go in public other than to pick up my grocery orders to avoid going in public places- it was work and home. Despite those efforts, in Dec 2021, I got Covid again. That time around it was more like the flu. I did experience body aches that time, but it was mild and not general to one location. I did not get the boosters because I developed myocarditis after the 2 Moderna vaccinations and it was recommended by my doctor to wait until more findings come out to avoid more stress on my heart in case I developed the condition again with the boosters. After a week of Covid #2, I was fine.   Despite the regulations lifting thereafter, I maintained wearing the masks daily, limited my outings to parks, trails, and remote locations with my kids despite my family and friends unwavering pleas to go out (they think Im paranoid), still picked up grocery orders, continued to wash my hands and use sanitizer regularly, etc., and as of this Friday, I have developed Covid again. I have a constant sore throat, persistent fevers/chills/headaches, nausea/vomiting/diarrhea (sorry), difficulty sleeping, severe fatigue (but cant sleep!!!), and body aches. The shoulder pain is back and I am on day 3 as I type this. It is not as intense as the first time, but it is moderate, and the doctor I saw couldnt explain it or diagnose the issue. They offered pain meds, but I wont take them. I want to treat the cause, not the symptom. I cant find much online about it and the closest thing I can find is related to shoulder neuropathy (Im not even sure if that is the correct terminology). I am wondering if anyone else has experienced this, and if so, what are your doctors saying about the condition? My only medical condition prior to any of this is hypothyroidism which runs in my family, and yes, unfortunately, I am a smoker.  Does anyone have any information on this symptom? Is it common? Will it go away? Are there studies that it could be longer lasting or damaging in the long run? I can't find too much on it and I know studies are still ongoing as Covid is new for us all, but the shoulder pain at times is intense. It truly feels like they are on fire- a burning sensation from the inside out. Hot to the touch, can't touch the shoulders at times as the pain gets intense, and Aleve, Tylenol, and ice/hot packs are ineffective. Im just drained and afraid of what is to come as reports coming out are now stating increased risks to health each time we get the virus, and it seems no matter the precautions taken, reinfection is inevitable- at least for me.  Any information anyone can share or provide would be greatly appreciated! The doctors here wont run tests on it, and while this bout is not as bad as the first time, the pain at times is unbearable.

It is faint and if I did not suffer from GAD then I probably wouldn't notice it.

This is the third time I've fallen ill with Covid .( within 9 monts) I have 2 vaccinations( Phizer, the most recent one received Sep 21) The first time I got infected was February this year while being on holiday in Tenerife. I was actually climbing mount Teide ( over 3000m) ,and i was feeling quite out of breath but i was sure it is just reaction to high altitude. When i came back to the UK i developed fatigue and headaches.Covid test was positive. Same for my husband. Symptoms weren't too bad and i continued working ( from home) In May we travelled to Peru and Chile. whilst being in Cusco( altitude 3400) i started to feel very light headed and out of breath. I was taken to the hospital and was diagnosed with altitude sickness, given oxygen and medicine.But didn't get much better. Covid test at rhat point was negative .Arrived in Chile and immediately fell ill with a cold .I had fever,cough, headaches and positive Covid. Once i recovered from that i got a stomach issues .I couldn't eat anything, felt nauseous, fatigued .Have not been feeling very well since then.Last week we went to Ireland to friend's wedding and decided to extend this trip to do some climbing which we love. Straight after the wedding i had noticed a little bit itchy throat which i blamed on AC , I had covid twice this year so didn't even consider it. And it wasn't anything big. so we climbed the highest mountain in Ireland( only over 1000m) Then it started to get worse.Developed sore throat, difficulty breathing, extreme fatigue ,runny nose and couldn't sleep .Once back home, did the Covid test which came back positive. This time i can't work or do any simple tasks.Even walking to the toilet is difficult.  My husband had negative test. I'm 35 years old female. I'm not overweight ( I'm slightly underweight). suffer from mild asthma,dust allergy. I do have anxiety and OCD also suffer from insomnia. I have done some health checks and tests after the second COVID and they all came back ok.

So I'm going to write my experiences and frustrations too, add them to the pile of stuff that's 'out there.'   Since I got covid 4 months ago, I've never been right. I describe it as 'good days' and 'bad days'. For the first couple of months, I would swing between days of heavy-limbed tiredness, irritability, intense thirst and hunger, random headaches that can last all day... aand 'good days' where I was fairly symptom free.   Toward the end of month 3, I had a week, one week of 'good days' and it reminded me what it's like to be me! That shot of regular life feeling was enough for me to really see the difference, it's like night and day. That week of good days was followed by two weeks of bad days, now there's barely a break in the clouds, and I gotta say the symptoms are getting worse.   I'm 49, but through looks/energy/vibe, I've often been taken for being in my mid thirties. Now I feel like I'm in my frakkin' 60s ><   My GP won't actually see me, because they're only taking emergency appointments, and have been for two years now. I called 111, and got a callback from a doctor, who easily diagnosed long covid, only to say I had to get a referral from my GP to the Long Covid Clinic.... which, ofc, I cannot do because my own GP won't take that kind of appointment.   At my work, I asked for a reduction in hours. I worked a lot before, 40-50 hours per week... now it's more like 30-40 per week. But I'm still struggling. i asked for a further hours reduction, but I can't get it. At every level, they say dumb things: My manager, 'you sound like you want to leave.' Her boss: '40 hours goes with your job title, we've done all we can.' His boss, 'yes, let's get you to your GP to see if you're fit for work,' .... well.. that's something else I can't do >< ... aaaand, her boss from Head Office, 'things will seem better when the summer sun comes out.'   I'm trying to cut down eeeevertying that takes effort, so that I can make it through these days, sometimes spending my whole weekend in bed, sleeping/napping/dozing... for the simple reason, that I can't move! I can sit in a chair, but it's .. head tips back, muslces are heavy, there's nothing I can do.... so I end up going back to bed! I arranged with my laundrette to deliver/pick up washing loads, so that I don't have to. The manager of the laundrette was interested in why I wanted this, and I told him about the long covid. He gave me a doubtful look.   I'm draggging myself thru these days. I expected every day.. every week... that this would just clear up... I understand that people have reported 6 months or more, I get that its a marathon. But 4 months in, and the symptoms are getting worse. Now I'm hearing there are lots of people who have had this one or two years, and we  dont know if the effects are lifelong in some cases, because we've only got two years of examples to go on.   I climb stairs every Friday morning, I work in a three storey building just on that particular day. Just as I get to the top, I cough, I always do, and I'm coughing up phlem. Proper, yellow/infected level of stuff is coming up. It's the only time I cough powerfully enough to bring stuff up from my lungs... but every week, without fail, I'm getting this sign of infection from my lungs! What is that about!? How can I have a live infection, week after week like that?   There's always an extra drain on my system, I can feel it, adding weight to my limbs, tightening my chest, making my breath and body labour over simply walking, or any kind of activity that was once so easy that the effects of it wouldn't even register on my awareness. Now they leave me worn out.   Even on good days, I'm massively conscious not to overdo things. I've tried exercise to get my body toward fitness quicker, but it takes an entire week to recover from that. Good day + too much activity = loooong string of bad days afterwards.   It's almost intolerable, and yet everyone reacts with shrugs or disbelief. I'm glad there's something of a community for this, damn,  finally sane responses!

I\u2019ve been reading articles saying that it\u2019s no longer necessary to disinfect your shopping; however, in the same breath, these articles that claim to be channelling science also state the importance of hand-washing before and after handling groceries you\u2019ve just purchased.

Eating heavy or fried foods also cause these episodes. The only thing that helps out is a strong black tea or consuming warm milk or water.

Personally, I think it is just the responsible thing to do because it not only helps protect you but it also protects those around you. I think people should do it just to look out for their loved ones. Although I understand people do not agree and believe it is unsafe. That is what I am planning to discuss.  People\u2019s fear of the vaccine- that being that it came out too fast and is unsafe- is very understandable; I\u2019m not going to lie, I was very skeptical of it at the beginning. When it first became available to people, I was thinking the same thing I\u2019m sure a lot of people were thinking, such as: how do we know this is safe? It came out way too fast, there is no way they were able to do enough tests on this, they don\u2019t know what the long term effects of this could be. After reading many non-biased and trustworthy articles over the vaccine, I do now believe it is safe and I think everyone should be receiving it. First off, scientists have been working on creating a SARS-CoV vaccine for more than 50 years meaning they have existing data on the structure, genome, and life cycle of this type of virus. In order to create the vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), scientists only had to manipulate the S-protein of the SARS-CoV vaccine. Since time was a luxury the world could not afford, scientists all over the world came together to create the COVID-19 vaccine as quickly and safely as possible. Being able to all compare their research on SARS-CoV, made it easier for them to come up with a safe vaccine for that, therefore leading to creating the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.  Since scientists have been able to do research and conduct testing SARS-CoV vaccines for the past many years, I believe it shows us that this COVID-19 vaccine actually did not come out too fast. It is the same virus as SARS-CoV, it just has a different S-protein strand which was easy for scientists to manipulate. I truly do believe this vaccine is safe and it is the only way we will be able to get past this. If you believe you\u2019ll be fine if you get the virus because you\u2019re young and healthy then think about others for a second. Sure, you may be fine and it may not affect you,  but it will/has affect those around you. We have lost 5.2 million people worldwide to this disease. We need to do everything in our power to stop this disease, and that requires thinking of others before yourself and getting vaccinated.

Maybe I am. However, I feel maybe I will get a more sympathetic response here. I live in Bristol England in case that\u2019s relevant. January 2020 my 18 year old daughter was very sick with a constant - every few seconds cough that lasted for days. She hardly ever gets sick. She had a mild fever and had fatigue. My son and I had very mild flu like symptoms. Since then I have had various random symptoms. A really scary episode where my vision and balance went crazy for a few hours followed by quite a few more milder episodes. Shaking and kind of spasms occasionally. My neighbour who I hang out with was taken to hospital a few months later and put on oxygen despite testing negative for COVID 3 times. A a few months later I had a few days of feeling poorly with more dizzy spells I took a COVID test. Later that day I got the first nosebleed I have ever had. We all assumed I had irritated my nostril with the swab. Result was negative. The nosebleeds became so extreme it was coming out my eyes and I was in A &E many times and eventually admitted as an in patient and \u2018fixed\u2019 in the most painful way. When my daughter went to her first year at Leeds university she had the same kind of episode of illness she had had previously but perhaps more cold like symptoms but still the cough. That week everyone in her tower block were testing positive for COVID. A month or two ago I went to see my daughter in Leeds as she was experiencing the same kind of illness only this time she had obviously developed tonsillitis and conjunctivitis alongside the coughing /sore throat. Her flatmates were also poorly but not so bad. After staying with her for two days after not having nosebleeds for months I suddenly got one out of the blue and they escalated in severity again. Leeds student accommodation then suddenly became one of the hot spots of covid with flat mate testing positive. The flatmate was one who hadn\u2019t tested positive previously. Now in Bristol which has recently become a hotspot my neighbour suddenly had uncontrollable shaking followed by a temperature (39.5) but unusually cold hands. His oxygen level was 95. He felt generally unwell and tired but recovered after 24 hours, apart from a very swollen foot. He had been double vaccinated as have I. He had recently played table tennis at a community centre where my friend\u2019s son has just had to isolate as his team leaders had tested positive after playing table tennis in the same room. My neighbour tested negative 3 times. I just had an episode of sudden hot ear and then cheek for a few hours and felt pretty tired. On the same side as my nosebleeds. My children had a weird reoccurrence of mild eczema. Is this all just coincidence? I\u2019m wondering if we are possibly catching covid again and again - every time our bodies come into contact with it it is doing it\u2019s best to fight it off and thankfully for my family and friends it seems the symptoms are reducing - possibly due to immunity and vaccinations. I apologise for this long message but I haven\u2019t seen anyone that has been experiencing anything similar and am just really interested if anyone has similar stories of being exposed to covid again and having symptoms and yet testing negative possibly because our bodies are doing so well at fighting it off we don\u2019t have enough virus in us to test positive.

I went on and got many tests done:  - MRI brain scan. Normal - CBC (WBC, RBC). Normal (hemoglobin normal) - Inflammation markers (CRP; ESR; D-dimer; Ferritin). Normal  - 24-Hour blood pressure monitoring. Systolic blood presure ranges between 100-130 (ave. 103) & Diastolic blood pressure ranges beteeen 58-80 (ave. 60).

This is also a rare serious disease that occurs in only 02, up to 0.6 percent of all pregnant women and also causes low platelets and clots. My body is therefore certainly able to cause this immune response, partly by non-body substances (half of the DNA is from the partner). This is something I never hope to experience again. And I am now terribly afraid of being vaccinated with 1 of these vaccines. Although I would very much like this partly because I belong to the risk group with asthma.   Are there any women here who have had pre-eclampsia or HELLP syndrome who have already been vaccinated? And have you experienced any side effects?", "id": 1103}, {"source": "https://patient.info/forums/discuss/chest-pain-for-10-days-751407", "question_title": "Chest Pain for 10 days", "responseCount": "8", "postDate": 1623740400, "question_text": "Hi I was diagnosed with Covid mid november.

After these 4 days and I started feeling progress, then I suddenly noticed  * breathing problems after lunch only.  * A lot of burping,  * dead skin around my nose  * needles feeling in my chest * Frequent red itchy skin at the lymphoid gland area as well as red itchy skin on the esophagus area * Can't talk a lot or shout as I feel sensitive in my throat   In June my esophagus was so inflamed that after touching the area of lymphoid gland, I had a fast heart beat and I went to do corona test which came negative. I went to the doctor who doubted that I have reflux and after trying Proton pump inhibitors for two weeks nothing changed and then he asked me to do a spectroscopy and we found nothing. Strangely that I found a friend of a friend that had the same symptoms but she even had blood coming from her throat. She did the spectroscopy and found that it was Helicobacter Pylori is the reason. My doctor simply told me, don't be scared because it seems to be a psychological problem.   I read online to see life habits to decrease the effect of reflux and what really made a difference was to avoid sitting in the bed before sleeping. That removed the most harsh symptom of breathing problems after lunch. Yet I went on with a lot of burping, daily dead skin around my nose and needles feeling in my chest and around every 3 weeks to have red itchy skin over lymphoid and esophagus.

My husband works at IT, he got his first dose of the vaccine, as did I, and we are waiting for our 2nd. (I am a stay at home mother.) We have a 4 year old daughter and an almost 1 year old who has an SVT since 2 months old.   We have been practically in a bubble. My husband works (masks required) and we do get groceries once a month (usually we do grocery pick up but we are on WIC so we do stop once a month to get WIC items.) The only people we have seen since this all began are my parents, who take it VERY serious, and my SIL, who also does.  My parents have been fully vaccinated (yay) now, but now that they have been, my sisters family will be visiting them every now and then. My sister's family does not take it serious at all, refuses to vaccinate or wear masks or social distance.   We know that there IS a possibility of spreading it even after being fully vaccinated, so we aren't sure how long we should stay away from my parents when they visit my sisters family.   I talked to her pediatrician and she had said it was \"up to us\" on how we felt.. either wait 2 weeks, or wait a week and see if they have symptoms.   The WIC clinic told me that it was \"very rare for someone vaccinated to pass it on\" and that we \"probably didn't have to worry\".   But others have told me not to risk it and do a full 2 week of distancing from them.   So I'm confused now. It'll be a week, Saturday, since my parents have seen my sisters family. They have some health problems  unrelated to covid (they both had had covid tests before this as they have had to go to the hospitals a few times for testing to see what's going on) but they have no covid symptoms.   Should we still quarantine another week with no contact, should we see them but have them wear masks (they have said they would if we wanted them to), or is it safe enough, since they are fully vaccinated and have been very careful for a week with no symptoms, to see them?  I know covid isn't as likely to be dangerous for children, but since our daughter had a heart condition (which we can thankfully say she has not had an episode since October now! but back in June-July it spiked her heart rate due to a simple fever she got) we have been scared to let anyone near the household.

Once the proteins, which don\u2019t cause disease, are produced, the body launches an immune response against the virus, enabling the person to develop immunity.  Question 1: the proteins are produced by cells that presumably go on to replicate, with the mRNA changes incorporated in their replications. Then the replicated cells produce more viral proteins, which our immune system will presumably attack. What happens when the number of modified cells is producing enough viral protein to overwhelm the immune system?  Question 2: Why does the body launch an immune response to something that is produced by our cells? Why does it not recognise that the viral proteins are produced internally, and so should not be attacked?  Question 3: If the immune system is attacking viral protein, what will it do when it sees, not just the \u201cspike\u201d, but the whole virus?

Felt like I had small blobs of phlegm stuck in my throat - not low enough to cough up and not high enough to blow out nose.  Not very hungry. * 25th Dec - the person I was in contact with passed away. (he DID have numerous underlying health conditions and sepsis from a UTI). Ability to smell and taste things 90% gone. * 28th Dec - go for a test. Feeling tired and breathless - this was thankfully minor and manageable. OK when I sit in the warm.  * 29th Dec - Positive result. I felt so so scared. I live in a with my Fiance and his mum. We are all in separate rooms - isolating. Never felt so alone and scared.  * 30th Dec to 2nd Jan - every night, going to bed anxious. Scared of getting worse, scared incase I have the same fate as the friend we lost. Weird dreams about food and craving food! Taste and smell came back over these days to about 80%.

Needless to say there was no way I was going to comply and I was quite prepared to go home if necessary. Eventually after some discussion a doctor was called and she said my mask was the best available and there was no problem. A second doctor then requested me to wear a blue surgical mask over mine. I did not object to this since I could see that his intention was to give the impression of uniformity.  All proceeded well until I eventually got to the vaccination station. There were four or five staff sitting as close together as it was possible to be. There was also a seat for me right next to them where I was requested to sit while they prepared the vaccine. I declined and said I would prefer to maintain a 2 metre distance except when the vaccine was being given.  The staff members didn't seem to understand why I was reluctant to sit near them!

The first 3 weeks were probably the worst as I was unable to get out of bed, week 4 saw a marked improvement and I thought I was recovering with nearly all symptoms disappearing save for some gastric issues but then in week 5 I started to relapse. I had pain in my back again and new symptoms of muscle pain in my arms, pain in my joints and a lot of tension in my upper body.  I have tested negative for the virus twice now in weeks 5 and 6.

It took about 2-3 weeks for her to \"recover.\"  Before Covid my mom could walk 35 feet in her walker and do all her exercises etc.  She was due to come home and then caught Covid.  In December she seemed to loose almost all her strength.  At the end of December she could stand for a few minutes and transition from bed to a chair.  She came home around new years day.  She came home because of insurance reasons, otherwise I would still have her with skilled nursing.  It was obvious when she came home that Covid had wiped out her strength.  Unfortunately about a week after coming home, she had a** stroke and UTI**.  She was in the hospital for about a week and then she came home again.  While visiting her in the hospital, I of course contacted Covid.  I had a nasty time of it, where the monoclonal antibodies really helped.  In the meantime, for the two weeks that I was really sick, I could only help my mom with a few things like food & meds.  Since coming home from the stroke she has been bedridden.  So here's my question - she is currently bedridden and I am wondering what kind of recovery is possible?  When do people typically get their strength back?  *I've heard of people taking months to recover*  I think the combination of **covid + stroke** has done a number on her, however she is alive (count blessings) and she is mostly still there mentally though a little slow.  I have tried doing exercises with her - bed exercises - and while she can do it, it totally wipes her out.  If you have been through anything like this, please let me know.  Any comments appreciated.  Thanks, Rob  PS - I have her on protein smoothies to get her strength back.  She is currently taking these supps: 1. Multi vitamin 2. D3 3. Fish Oil 4. cranberry concentrate - for UTI 5. womens probiotic (she also has an antibiotic for UTI) 6. zinc ", "id": 1206}, {"source": "https://patient.info/forums/discuss/test-postive-754634", "question_title": "Test postive", "responseCount": "0", "postDate": 1611990000, "question_text": "sars covid 2 rna does that mean I have it now or had it once before I'm confused.....", "id": 1207}, {"source": "https://patient.info/forums/discuss/covid-19-it-s-my-3rd-month-in-and-my-asthma-is-worse-than-ever-754479", "question_title": "COVID -19 - It's my 3rd month in and my asthma is worse than ever", "responseCount": "1", "postDate": 1611903600, "question_text": "Hi  I tested positive on the 4th November and although I have recovered from COVID to test negative, my asthma is bad.

Is there an alternative way in which Covid-19 can be stopped..?   The biggest problem with isolating once you have the symptoms is that it\u2019s too late; the virus has been passed on already in the several days previous when there were no symptoms. If only we knew from day 1 when people got infected rather than several days later.   Maybe the answer is **separation** and not isolation?  i.e. separate the people who won't keep their distance/wash their hands from those who will. The former group (the pro-covid group) are probably going to get it anyway. So let them get it in a controlled way and they can separate themselves from others before they catch it. This will stop super-spreaders.  What if shops, pubs, other small businesses and people were to identify themselves as \u2018pro-covid\u2019 or \u2018anti-covid\u2019. So people who have Covid or who don\u2019t believe in taking precautions would be classed as \u2018pro-covid\u2019 and can shop, eat, drink at specific places (or times) as long as they wear an identifiable pro-covid marker like a lanyard so that \u2018anti-covid\u2019 people and vulnerable people who want to take precautions and wash their hands know who they are and can keep their distance. The problem is not everyone believes in exercising caution or distancing and you can\u2019t force them to. These people will probably catch it anyway so let them catch it, but rather than allowing them to be a super-spreader and passing it on unknowingly to vulnerable people in public, let them 'shop and spread' in a controlled environment. Whether that be in designated areas or specific times of the day. So people who want to be safe will be safer and people who believe in freedom and want to take their chances can do so.   A good example would be to use students who can isolate in halls with like-minded people - because a certain percentage of them are going to mix anyway so identify the ones who are going to mingle anyway and let them socialise in their pro-covid bubble where they can catch it at the same time. This will give them and others they come into contact with in the future greater protection from greater immunity. A certain percentage may catch it again, but what percentage is this? Less than 5%? Surely that\u2019s a good trade off. It will also allow others who are vulnerable or who fully intend to stick to the rules can fully separate themselves from the other spreaders. This is the only way to limit the spread! And it needn\u2019t be for a long time, just a 2 week trial. At the very least it should be piloted in one area. Such as a university, where they are not interacting with others who do not have covid.   Even if just 1 young healthy person in a thousand were to become seriously ill from getting covid after such an experiment - they would have prevented the spread from infecting a further 3 to 4 thousand people!

I live in New York (not NY City) and my area has been experiencing some spikes of covid, pretty much like everywhere else. I attended church this morning and am now extremely worried about being exposed to covid.  My church only has masses at 33% capacity and they are good about sanitizing the church after every mass. We maintain social distance (only every other pew is occupied with people well spread out and ushers will seat you) and wear masks, and all that. This morning I was seated 2 pews behind a family with 3 girls, looked like between ages of 8 and 14/15. They were all wearing masks but the middle girl (about 12 or 13?) was wearing it with her nose exposed the whole time. She was the only one not wearing it properly and neither of her parents seemed to care. She kept turning to her mother every minute or so and went to speak to her a couple of times, actually pulling the mask away from her mouth briefly as she did so. I couldn't believe it. I wanted to alert the ushers but they seemed oblivious and were too far away for me to get their attention.  Granted I have no idea if this girl is carrying covid. She didn't seem to look ill (she let out a tiny cough at one point but that was it) but the thing that worries me the most is asymptomatic spread and that you just don't know. She might even not know if she's carrying it (if she actually was). I was a fair distance away, not directly behind her (I'd say they were at least 10 feet in front of me and she was seated diagonally to my left). I was wearing an N95 mask that fit properly but I keep hearing how even they aren't enough to protect you.  I've got enough anxiety at the moment due to PMS (plus I'm a germophobe) so this is making it worse. Is there an extremely good chance I could have been exposed and infected? I'm very worried and thinking I can only rest easy until around the 17th or so if I haven't shown symptoms by then.

I have received a letter from authorities telling me I will have to have an 'mRNA vaccine'.  I am a 65 year old male in generally good health and live in the UK.  I'm in the 5th Category (according to UK organisers) to get the vaccine.  They only have the Pfizer one just now with 'emergency approval' and are currently vaccinating people with it.  I fear by the time they get round to me  - say, February / March - that I may well get the AstraZeneca/Oxford one.  I know I will need a mRNA shot to fulfil the authorities' request.  (I assume this is because of the questions raised by the AstraZeneca trials - which is certainly fair - most definitely for someone my age because only 12% of people my age were involved in their trial - only 4% over 70.  I'm praying they just may make it - i.e., the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine - for under 55's. )  In any case I will need to get an mNRA vaccine - with which I'm fine with.  My question - which I can't seem to get anyone to answer - at least so far -  is this:  If I was to get the initial AstraZeneca (Vector) vaccine ... could I still have an mRNA one (say either Pfizer or Moderna)???  Would it be safe to do so?  Or are you restricted to one kind of format once you've had it originally???  Any one know how long should be between the two shots?  I'm thinking about three months - as that is the minimum length that theyseem to think those who have endured Covid have substantial antibodies following - or so I've read.

I tested positive for CoronaVirus back at the start of October, prior to this i wasn't the healthiest person with a weight of 18.5 stone and no physical work outs, most sat between a computer and bed. I started with a fever which lasted 2 days and a small cough, i took and test and found out i had covid. The fever didnt get worse, but i did start to feel faint, and often began to have a few panic attacks when i felt i couldnt catch my breath, but i kept myself isolated away from my family. I then lost my sense of taste and smell after 3 days. All in all during having covid i was okay, other than the odd need to lie down and take some deep breaths on occasion i was doing my normal routine. 14 days later all of my symptoms where gone and i ordered a new test, this came back negative.  O how i wish to be back in those days as from here it only gets worse.  For the next few weeks i suffered with tiredness, shortness of breath awful chest pain, and an uncomfortable throat, not sore just not right. i used paracetamol daily, and was advice by my GP to use anti inflammatory over the counter medicine for my throat if i felt it was swollen. I used Ice packs and hot water bottles on my chest which really seemed to calm me down and easy the pain. By this point we are on week 4 and my shortness of breath just seems to be getting worse, i speak to my GP as ive been having stomach problems, constipation for a few days at a time with barely any bowl movement. I was prescribed a brown inhaler and advised on some over the counter laxatives to try to help. The brown inhaler does the trick for a little while and i feel i can take deep breaths again, the laxitive seems to give me some relief, but only a bowl movement every 2 days and its often diharea. I keep on like this for a week or so before i start to feel short on breath again, my aunty allows me to use her unopened spare blue inhaler and my GP lets me go for blood tests, they also then prescribe me a blue inhaler. The blood tests show high levels of dead red blood cells in my liver function, that they arnt too concerned about, and i am sent on my way for blood tests in 2 weeks time. About a week later my chest started to sound like their was fluid in there and i had an abnormal heart beat occuring so i went to A+E, they did blood work, a scan of the chest, blood preasure and oxygen levels and told me they can seem to find anything at risk and that im 'fit and healthy to go'.   That was week 8 and all of last week i felt so bad, chest aches, pains in my arm pits when i lay or move certain ways, breathless, and a weight on my chest. I phoned my GP on thursday to discuss getting a new brown inhaler as mine seemed yo not work as it used to, after discussing how i was feeling she gave me a 5 day course of steroid tablets and a x-ray to be done at my local hostpital between 9:30 nd 4:30 any week day. I take my first round of tablets and my chest feels so relieved, but the strange slow covered heart beat is still there and keeps me on edge, i have my x-ray and come home to a call from my GP about my second blood tests and the ones from A+E, they say my liver function tests are still a bit abnormal and that i have a high count of redblood cells, to which they can wait 3 momths and see of its covid after effects or organise an untralsound, i opt for the later and await the hospital to mail. I explain my heart/lung feeling to the GP and he prescribes me  a 5 day course of antibiotics to take with my 5 day steroid tablets.  Day 1 felt good, things seemed okay, day 2 was a bit achey but once again okay and towards the night i felt like a new man. Day 3 was worse, tight chest most of the day, aches and pains, shortness of breath, and my neck just started to feel so stiff and clogged. Im on day 4 today and once again my chest is so heavy, my breathing feels shallow but i can take deep breaths on occassion, and i have 1 day left to pray i feel better before the course is complete. I still but far less frequently feel the odd heart beat and lung feeling, but my chest feels like a pair of hands is pushing on the top of my pecks no matter how i try to sit or lay.  All in all thats my story so far, week 9 begins today, im constantly scared to sleep and not wake up, or to wake up and be in more pain or have more issues. I just want to have 1 day of normal. I cant even do the things i used to enjoy like sit at a computer and talk with friends or play games, because i just feel so closed in and tight and on edge, last night i had a mild panic attack from just sitting there for 2 hours feeling breathless.  is there anyone that can relate or feels the same?

He got tested positive for covid and was kept in the hospital for a week  where he  got better, then we had to take him home because he made a huge fuss since he hates hospitals and feels very uncomfortable staying there. Doc said his oxygen level drops without an oxygen mask, so after much effort , we got him an oxygen concentrator. 1 week later, he has no fever and probably no other symptoms except for shortness of breath and low oxygen level. At first, he could stay 1 hour+ until his oxygen level drops to 80s, but now he's always on the concentrator. He doesn't say it, but i can tell he doesn't sleep much at night and sometimes his voice is hoarse during the day, his respiratory rate is around 24-27 bpm, and i don't know how long it will take for him to heal (if it will). He's taking enoxaparin 40mg and we're always checking his pulse ( usually jumps between high 80s and 90-95 with concentrator) and his sugar levels.

My husband (39) was struck down with it at the end of March. I (37) got it exactly a week later, early April. A couple of weeks later both my boys (2 & 4) suffered with mild symptoms. April was a hard month.  We fought off the virus at home, we were never tested as they weren't testing unless you were seriously in need of hospital care. So there is the worry that we didn't have Covid, however we had almost all the symptoms at some point in April and we are living with the havoc is causes to your body and mind still today.  I have achey days where I can barely move. I still suffer with chest pains. Sharp in the front and the feeling that somebody is sat on my back. Early June I attempted some light exercise and was left with a crackly breath and horrendous chest pains. I went to A&E and luckily it wasn't lung clots, however its muscle damage/scarring in my lungs. I was informed like its no big deal and I should just rest for 3-6 months. This is a big deal to an active person like myself who relies heavily on exercise to help my mental health too! I suffer with headaches that put me in bed for a few hours due to the dizziness/nausea they cause.  I also don't have a great digestive system anymore.   My Husband has the dizziness/nausea/headache symptoms come back every fortnight that put him in bed for a day or two. This has also caused issues with his digestive system.   My little 2 year old has had a recurring cough for weeks and weeks. I worry. I try not to but this is so concerning. The doctors aren't concerned because he is well in himself and there are no signs of an infection. This is sad that its now deemed ok for him to suffer with a bad cough for so long.   What I'm starting to get annoyed over is the media's focus being solely on the survival rate. We are survivors yet our health is severely affected. People are going about their lives thinking this won't affect them because they're young and healthy and it will. There are even articles written on asymptomatic people who show lung issues.  I am so angry this has happened to us and scared about what this means for my children's health in the future. As somebody who already was affected by anxiety on a daily basis I am concerned over my growing obsession with this and what it is also doing to my mental health.   We are taking Vitamin D and eating healthy, as we were before Covid. We are no longer exercising as much. I don't know what else I can do to help my family going forward.   Thank you for listening.

I researched and read every article out there on symptoms, pandemic management, contagion etc. I also read up way too many healthcare pages and self diagnosed all sorts of whacky symptoms and side effects. I tried asthma and allergy medication,  I tried steroids, abx, the works... I had cat scans, x rays and blood tests, Mr saw at least 3 doctors. Nothing was wrong with me. No with my body at least... I had a flu, maybe even covid, but that didn't  last longer than a couple of weeks. my cough and tiredness must have lingered a bit, but the disease was gone. What happened to me, and I'm sure to most of you out there, is that at some point in our worries we transitioned from a physical illness to an anxiety disorder, and this requires a diametrically opposed treatment to what we're doing. I could not believe anxiety could cause such physical symptoms, but believe me when I say it can. Myalgia, burning sensation, chest tightness, GI symptoms... I suffered from all of these things excruciatingly.

I was beginning to worry that it wasn't covid and if not what the hell was it, but he said he speaks to patients every day with the same symptoms as many of us on here who have been also suffering for many weeks and some of these have had positive tests for  covid and is very certain that's what I've had. He also said the reason I'm struggling is to do with the alveoli in the lungs. He said they are not getting the oxygen to the body properly which is why your chest sounds clear but you can't breathe. He was very insistent about this.  This article helps explain it: https://health.clevelandclinic.org/heres-the-damage-coronavirus-covid-19-can-do-to-your-lungs/ He also said the antibody tests are not great and to just take it that it is covid I've had. He said to carry on with what I've been doing ; walking gently when I can. He also said other patients symptoms are also up and down just like mine and proof of my o2 stats fluctuating is proof it's my alveoli not working properly (I have a fitness tracker which also measures o2).

I hope I'm not over posting which I know can be irritating but I've had such success with the treatment method described below that I'm on a real campaign to encourage Corona patients to try it.   Feedback would be great.  Anything from \"nope, didn't work for me to yes I'm healed\" would be appreciated.Pray we can beat this thing.   I had flu symptoms coming on strong on March 25, 2020.  Not sure if it was Corona or just regular flu.   Anyway I immediately used a method I call my \"kill flu\" treatment which I've been using with 100% success for the past 20 years.   Just suggesting that you try it because it's been so successful for me.  Hoping it could be successful for you.   Very simple: A. Drink 3 glasses of very warm water (not hot enough to burn you but definitely very warm). B.  Use a hair blower on medium temperature to blow warm air onto your face for 30 minutes.   C.  Use deep breathing for the 30 minutes to repeatedly fill your lungs with warm air.  Also breathe in through your nose for awhile then through your mouth etc. trade back and forth.  D.  Do this 2 to three times a day for a couple of days.Hope this works for you.    It literally changed my life  20 years ago.   I'm a retired teacher and when I first started teaching I would get quite sick multiple times with the flu each year from October to March.  Called in sick constantly during that time period each year.   Finally out of desperation and much research I came up with the method described above.  I had reached the point where I was considering quitting teaching.   First time I used this method I was back to normal in one day.   From that point on I never called in sick again due to the flu.   I've been reading so many stories of people suffering through Corona; it just tears at me. I\u2019m  making this suggestion to as many as possible.   It definitely  worked for me on the flu (and possibly on Corona in March).   I really hope this method works for Corona patients.

I just wanted to check if these sounded like coronavirus symptoms?  Yesterday morning both me and my partner woke up feeling very hot - we believe this is because we had a winter duvet on the bed and have no air flow or windows in the bedroom, and with the warmer weather, we think  we must have overheated a little. When I got up to go to the toilet, I felt really hot and a little light-headed, achy. I didn't want to touch my usual morning tea  as I felt queasy as well. I attempted to eat lunch, but only felt more nauseous after a couple bites. My boyfriend, although he felt hot and a little nauseous upon waking up, felt fine after an hour or two, and still is.  Early in the afternoon, I threw up. I felt better and relieved of my nausea for a little while until I started to feel achy, nauseous and feverish again. I was sick again shortly after. I had a couple of naps in the afternoon which made me feel better. By the end of the day I felt significantly better, only a little achy and a little hot. I never measured my temperature as I don't currently have a thermometer, but it felt that any potential fever was dwindling as I was no longer fidgeting or feeling any slight chills.  I slept well, only woke up with a slight headache and much lesser body aches, which have mostly gone as of now.  I no longer feel feverish or hot to touch, and have been able to eat and drink (just unable to do my usual quantities). I look a lot better today too. I would just like to say that I am not pregnant (haven't had sex since my last period), and I have had zero contact with the outside world since lockdown has begun. I am isolating with my boyfriend and his family at their home in a rural area. I only go out for walks. His parents have been doing the shopping as we are working from home full-time. They have been very careful in doing so and follow all the precautions.  I was going to consider being tested today if I still felt feverish, but I don't. Nobody believes I have it, but I am a hypochondriac so it still worries me. I have no other symptoms and feel far better today. Should I be concerned that this is covid?

Advice?", "responseCount": "4", "postDate": 1589785200, "question_text": "I live in New York on Long Island, which is still considered a hot spot. Our state's lockdown is supposed to start easing on Friday, but will probably take at least a few weeks longer for my region.   I've got to make 3 visits to health care facilities next week and I'm very worried. Tuesday morning I have an appointment for a yearly mammogram/ultrasound. Another day (either Wed or Thurs, I haven't decided yet) I'm supposed to go to a lab to have blood work done for my yearly physical, which is on the 27th. And then Friday I have another yearly physical at my pulmonologist's office (was diagnosed with mild asthma when I was 12, though starting to wonder if I outgrew it as I no longer take daily medication for it and my symptoms have pretty much disappeared).  The thing that concerns me the most is exposure to a significant viral load. I'd read some good info not long ago that it's the viral load that does you in with this virus.. that going to the supermarket for a short time or being outside doesn't normally expose to you a great amount of the virus, but if you're in an indoor, enclosed setting for a greater period of time especially  with a large group of people, you could get exposed to a huge dose of it. I know hospitals carry the threat of a great amount of exposure (my uncle is currently hospitalized for non-covid-related kidney failure and they forbid us to visit him), and I'm wondering if it's that bad for doctors' offices and medical labs.  I did call the lab last week for info on precautions they're taking. They're having patients call them from their car in the parking lot and letting them know when to come up to the lab. They're also requiring them to wear masks (but not gloves, for some reason). That makes me feel a little better, but the radiology group where I'm having the mammogram done hadn't said anything when I called last month to reschedule (appt was originally on the 18th of April).  I'm also wondering if I should reschedule my pulmonologist appt. Like I said this is just a yearly follow-up, it's not an urgent appt.  I'm just very uncomfortable about being in this type of setting three days in a row with the danger of being exposed again with this area still being a hot spot. One of the offices (primary care doctor I think) said their health care workers get tested daily, but I'm concerned about coming into contact with other patients who may be asymptomatic and could infect me. I'm 42 and no underlying chronic conditions (save for the very mild asthma which again I suspect I've outgrown) but I hear about people around my age who the media say are \"otherwise healthy\" becoming critically ill. I haven't left my house since the beginning of March when I'd seen my primary care doctor for an upper respiratory infection. I've gone outside walking my dogs in the neighborhood and exercising in my back yard, but I haven't gone shopping or anything like that...other family members have done so over the past 2 months and thankfully they haven't been sick. But again I'm concerned about the environment of the doctors' offices. Any advice? Should I cancel all the appts or maybe just keep 1?
