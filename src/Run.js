This is most obvious with the lungs if they become scarred - long-term problems have been seen after infection with Sars or Mers, which are both types of coronavirus. But Covid may also alter people's metabolism. There have been cases of people struggling to control their blood sugar levels after developing diabetes as a result of Covid, and Sars led to changes in the way the body processed fats for at least 12 years. There are early signs of changes to brain structure, but these are still being investigated. And Covid-19 also does strange things to the blood, including abnormal clotting, and damaging the network of tubes that carry blood around the body.'

          "Hi! I'm a 21 year old man, relatively healthy. As of yesterday I was diagnosed with Covid.  Before this, I had no issue getting or holding erections. But after my diagnosis, it's like no matter what I do, I cannot get hard. I did some research and found that ED can be a side effect of Covid, but this early on, that fast? Every article talks about how it's generally something that's a result of long covid. I can't find any articles saying if this is permanent, or if this is something that will subside as my symptoms begin to go away, or if this is just a symptom due to Covid and not a form of Covid induced ED. Any help or advice or anything would really be appreciated as I am currently really worried. 21 and having ED doesn't sound fun, especially when I'm fully vaccinated and have the booster shot too. ",
